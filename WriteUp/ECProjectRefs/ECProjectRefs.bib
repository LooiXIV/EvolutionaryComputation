	abstract = {Gauging the impact of manipulative activities, such as rehabilitation or management, on wetlands requires having a notion of the unmanipulated condition as a reference. And understanding of the reference condition requires knowledge of dominant factors influencing ecosystem processes and biological communities. In this paper, we focus on natural physical factors (conditions and processes) that drive coastal wetland ecosystems of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Great Lakes coastal wetlands develop under conditions of large-lake hydrology and disturbance imposed at a hiearchy of spatial and temporal scales and contain biotic communities adapted to unstable and unpredictable conditions. Coastal wetlands are configured along a continuum of hydrogeomorphic types: open coastal wetlands, drowned river mouth and flooded delta wetlands, and protected wetlands, each developing distinct ecosystem propertics and biotic communities. Hydrogeomorphic factors associated with the lake and watershed operate at a hierarchy of scales: a) local and short-term (seiches and ice action), b) watershed / lakewide / annual (seasonal water-level change), and c) larger or year-to-year and longer (regional and/or greater than one-year). Other physical factors include the unique water quality features of each lake. The aim of this paper is to provide scientists and managers with a framework for considering regional and site-specific geomorphometry and a hierarchy of physical processes in planning management and conservation projects.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to review the relationship between fluctuating water levels and shoreline vegetation dynamics in the Great Lakes. Low water periods allow many plant species and vegetation types to regenerate from buried seeds. A review of published seed bank densities shows that some lakeshores have densities of buried seeds greater than l04 seeds m−2, an order of magnitude greater than densities reported from prairie marshes. High water periods kill dominant species (e.g., Typha sp.), thereby creating gaps which other species can colonize during low water periods. High water also kills woody plants, thereby extending marshes landward. Fluctuating water levels therefore increase the area of shoreline vegetation, and the diversity of vegetation types and plant species. Any stabilization of water levels would likely reduce marsh area, vegetation diversity, and plant species diversity. Four basic shoreline vegetation types (forest and shrub thickets, wet meadow, marsh, and aquatic) can be recognized; both wet meadow and marsh largely result from fluctuating water levels.},

Previous studies of these populations have demonstrated that these two species are segregated according to water depth with T. latifolia being competitively superior in shallow water (less than 15 cm) but T. angustifolia having the potential to grow in deeper water than T. latifolia. Results from this study indicate that T. latifolia is competitively superior in shallow water because of its greater leaf surface area but tha..., Les caractéristiques morphologiques et l'allocation de la biomasse ont été étudiées chez deux espèces de Typha dans un petit étang.

Chez les deux espèces, les plantes croissant dans l'eau plus profonde ont des feuilles plus longues, une allocation plus forte aux feuilles et une allocation plus faible à la reproduction sexuée et végétative.

	abstract = {(1) This paper examines the phenology of Typha in floating mats, following drainage or seasonal burning or both, in marshes where water-level can be controlled, near the Bay of Fundy (New Brunswick, Canada). On both drained and flooded areas, four burning treatments (spring, summer, autumn and no burning) were superimposed in 1981. The fires were more intense than would occur naturally but we wished to establish resistance to change. (2) Drainage and subsequent burning in summer reduced the Typha standing crop, by the end of the vegetation period following the treatments, to 20\% of that in the flooded, unburned treatment. (3) Typha survived the disturbance and no major shifts in species composition were observed. (4) The results suggest that the Typha floating mat is resilient and will recover quickly from the range of drying and burning regimes that could be imposed under the normal climatic conditions of the Bay of Fundy area. (5) It is hypothesized from the present short-term study that these flooded areas may move toward bog-like conditions in the absence of continued and severe human disturbance.},

	abstract = {The seasonal contribution of living Typha components to the buoyancy of floating mats was investigated in a diked, freshwater impoundment near the head of the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick, Canada. The objectives were (1) to examine the potential influence of a dominant, mat-building species on hydrologic conditions at the mat surface, and (2) to predict whether a complete killing of the dominant species could cause mats to sink. The Typha component contributing most to mat buoyancy was the rhizomes, which added a net buoyancy pressure of @?20 Pa throughout the growing season. The seasonal maximum buoyancy contribution of 28 Pa for all living Typha components combined was reached in spring, followed by a decline to 11 Pa in late summer as the aboveground shoots developed. This positive and seasonally variable contribution of Typha to mat buoyancy is expected to be most important during the early stages of mat development, when mats are thin and composed largely of living, belowground organs. However, on older and thicker mats the living Typha is less important because of the large volumes of gas bubbles from anaerobic decomposition that are trapped in the dead organic material. For the 50 cm thick floating mats under study, it is concluded that trapped gas is the main cause of buoyancy and would lead to the continued flotation of mats even if the living Typha were removed. Implications of the results are discussed in relation to the resiliency of floating mat systems.},

	abstract = {Hydrologic disturbance can affect wetland and aquatic macrophyte communities by creating temporal changes in soil moisture or water depth. Such disturbances are natural and help maintain wetland diversity; however, anthropogenic changes in wetland hydrology may have negative effects on wetlands. Since plant communities respond to habitat alterations, observations of plant-community changes may be used to recognize effects of hydrologic disturbances that are otherwise not well understood. A number of plants, including Typha angustifolia (narrow-leaf cattail) and Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife), are recognized as disturbance species; they are often found in roadside ditches, in wetlands that have been partially drained, or in low areas that have been flooded. Other species commonly occur on mudflats exposed by lowering of water levels. In addition, wetland shrubs and trees invade or die as a result of draining or flooding. In more subtle terms, the relative composition of plant communities can change without the addition or loss of species, and zonation patterns may develop or change as a result of altered hydrology. Remote sensing (photointerpretation) and field vegetation studies, coupled with monitoring of water levels, are recommended for gaining an understanding of hydrologic disturbances in wetlands.},

Complex has been altered from its historic mixed sedge-grass domination (Carexstricta,Calamagrostiscanadensis) in lower areas and woody growth in slightly elevated areas, as based on archival aerial photographs from 1938–1982 and recent field data. Cattails (Typha spp.) were present in 1938 and made minor gains in cover through 1970. However, the major invasion of cattails appears to be associated with stabilized, increased water levels caused by seepage from diked ponds constructed upgradient from the wetland in the early 1970s. The water level increases are assumed to have been of a magnitude which adversely affected the sedge-grass community but did not preclude cattail growth. The cattail vegetation type increased in cover from 2.0 ha in 1938 to 9.7 ha in 1970 to 37.5 ha in 1982. The sedge-grass vegetation type correspondingly decreased from 56.4 ha to 43.0 ha to 5.7 ha. Cattail invasion appears to have occurred through establishment of disjunct colonies by seed reproduction, followed by vegetative expansion and merging of the colonies.},

	abstract = {The diversity and resultant habitat value of wetland plant communities in the Laurentian Great Lakes are dependent on water-level fluctuations of varying frequency and amplitude. Conceptual models have described the response of vegetation to alternating high and low lake levels, but few quantitative studies have documented the changes that occur. In response to recent concerns over shoreline management activities during an ongoing period of low lake levels in lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron that began in 1999, we analyzed a quantitative data set from Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron collected from 1988 to 1993 during a previous lake-level decline to provide the needed information on vegetation responses. Transects were established that followed topographic contours with water-level histories that differed across a six-year period, ranging from barely flooded to dewatered for varying numbers of years to never dewatered. Percent cover data from randomly placed quadrats along those transects were analyzed to assess floristic changes over time, document development of distinct plant assemblages, and relate the results to lake-level changes. Ordinations showed that plant assemblages sorted out by transects that reflect differing water-level histories. Distinction of assemblages was maintained for at least three years, although the composition and positioning of those assemblages changed as lake levels changed. We present a model that uses orthogonal axes to plot transects by years out of water against distance above water and sorted those transects in a manner that matched ordination results. The model suggests that vegetation response following dewatering is dependent on both position along the water level/soil moisture gradient and length of time since dewatering. This study provided quantitative evidence that lake-level fluctuations drive vegetative change in Great Lakes wetlands, and it may assist in making decisions regarding shoreline management in areas that historically supported wetlands.},

The status of the baiji has not been investigated since the late 1990s, when the surviving population was estimated to be as low as 13 individuals. An intensive six-week multi-vessel visual and acoustic survey carried out in November–December 2006, covering the entire historical range of the baiji in the main Yangtze channel, failed to find any evidence that the species survives. We are forced to conclude that the baiji is now likely to be extinct, probably due to unsustainable by-catch in local fisheries. This represents the first global extinction of a large vertebrate for over 50 years, only the fourth disappearance of an entire mammal family since AD 1500, and the first cetacean species to be driven to extinction by human activity. Immediate and extreme measures may be necessary to prevent the extinction of other endangered cetaceans, including the sympatric Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis).},

A significant hypolimnetic oxygen deficit (0.4 ppm, 3.5\% saturation) in late summer and the rate of oxygen depletion from 1 August to 19 September (0.13 mg/ml/day) further indicate eutrophic conditions. Of the three groups considered in this study (Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Cyanophyta), the Cyanophyta were less diverse in terms of relative numbers of genera but produced the largest blooms. Chlorophyta had the greatest number of genera. Diatoms dominated in winter and spring, Chlorophyta in summer and fall and blue-greens in late summer, fall and winter. Spirogyra and Oscillatoria were the most ubiquitous members of the algal flora. Important perennials included Oscillatoria, Spirogyra, Closterium, Fragilaria, Meridion, Tabellaria and Cymbella. No unialgal blooms ever occurred. The accelerated rate of eutrophication in recent years is due primarily to excess nutrient loading resulting from input of raw domestic sewage. The completion of a sanitary sewer system is expected to alleviate the excessive nutrient loading and thereby slow the eutrophication process.},

Threshold food concentrations for growth, calculated from the carbon budget for different Daphnia species, were biased when adaptation of the filter screens was ignored. Daphnids used for measuring assimilation rates are usually cultured at high levels of food and thus have small filter screens. If filter-screen enlargement is taken into consideration in estimating assimilation rates, thresholds come close to the realistic values measured in long-term growth experiments. Filter-screen adaptability is considered a response to varying nutritional conditions in the pelagic zone.},

In terms of carbon content these algal concentrations corresponded to 0.29, 0.58, 1.16, 2.33, 4.65 and 9.31 μg ml−1, respectively. Cladocerans in the tested range of algal levels responded similarly, in that increasing the food concentrations resulted in higher numerical abundance and population growth rates (r). The peak population densities were (mean±standard error) 71±5; 17.1±0.4, 3.6±0.3, 12.7±1.1, 18.2±2.7, 15.8±1.0 and 10.9±0.02 ind. ml−1, respectively for A. rectangula, C. dubia, D. laevis, D. brachyurum, M. macrocopa, S. kingi and S. vetulus. In general, the lowest r values were obtained for D. laevis (0.01±0.001) at 0.05×106 cells ml−1 food level while the highest was 0.283±0.004 for A. rectangula at 1.6×106 cells ml−1 of Chlorella. When the data of peak population density for each cladoceran species were plotted against the body length, we found an inverse relation, broadly curvilinear in shape. From regression equations between the food level and rate of population increase, we calculated the theoretical food quantity (the threshold level) required to maintain a zero population growth (r = 0) for each cladoceran species, which varied from 0.107 to 0.289 μg ml−1 d−1 depending on the body size. When we plotted the cladoceran body size against the corresponding threshold food levels, we obtained a normal distribution curve. From this it became evident that for up to 1300 μm body size, the threshold food level increased with increasing body size; however, beyond this, the threshold level decreased supporting earlier observations on rotifers and large cladocerans.},

	abstract = {We quantified changes in the population abundance of Daphnia ambigua, separately cultured on Chlorella vulgaris or Scenedesmus acutus, respectively, at three different algal concentrations (dry weight, 1.45, 4.35, and 13.05 μg ml−1). These population growth experiments were carried out for 30 days under laboratory conditions, with the medium and the algal food (at the initial density) renewed daily. Our study showed that a population of D. ambigua grew well on either Chlorella vulgaris or Scenedesmus acutus, when offered as an exclusive diet. Regardless of the algal type, increased algal density generally resulted in an increased population abundance of D. ambigua. The peak population abundance of D. ambigua was approximately 6 ind.ml−1 on Chlorella, at a concentration of 4.35 μg ml−1. The rate of population increase of D. ambigua varied from 0.123 ± 0.012 to 0.224 ± 0.006 per day, depending on the algal species and its concentration. Daily population growth rates of D. ambigua when plotted as a function of population density, yielded an inverse relationship. These results are interpreted in terms of population growth characteristics of various species of Daphnia from the literature. /// Se cuantificaron los cambios en la densidad poblacional de Daphnia ambigua, cultivadas por separado con las algas Chlorella vulgaris y Scenedesmus acutus en 3 diferentes concentraciones (peso seco, 1,45, 4,35 y 13,05 μg ml−1). Los experimentos de crecimiento poblacional se llevaron a cabo durante 30 días bajo condiciones del laboratorio, con el medio y la densidad de alga diariamente renovada. El estudio mostró que la población de D. ambigua creció de manera similar con ambos tipos de alga, cuando se ofrece como una dieta exclusiva cualquiera de ellas. En general, independientemente del tipo de algae, el aumento en la concentración de alimento resultó en un incremento aumento en la densidad de la población de D. ambigua. La densidad poblacional máxima de D. ambigua fue aproximadamente de 6 ind.ml−1 con C. vulgaris a una concentración de 4,35 μg ml−1. La tasa de crecimiento poblacional de D. ambigua vario de 0,125 ± 0,012 a 0,224 ± 0,006 d−, dependiendo de la concentración y tipo de alga. Las tasas de crecimiento diario de D. ambigua cuando se graficaron en función de la densidad poblacional, se obtuvo una relación inversa. Estos resultados se interpretan en términos de crecimiento poblacional de las diferentes especies de Daphnia según la literatura disponible.},

	abstract = {The objective of our study was to investigate sexual reproduction of Daphnia magna associated with mating behaviors and hatching rates, according to different algal food sources. Since a diatom is known to contain more abundant long‐chain poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), we hypothesized that the diatom‐consuming D. magna would exhibit more successful reproduction rates. Upon the hypothesis, we designed three experiments using two algal species, a green alga (Chlorella vulgaris) and a diatom (Stephanodiscus hantzschii). From the results, we found that the mating frequency and copulation duration increased in the treatment with S. hantzschii, resulting in a significant increase of hatching rates of resting eggs. In the other two repetitive mating strategies (e.g., one female vs. multiple males, and one male vs. multiple females), we found that the hatching rates of resting eggs were greater in the S. hantzschii treatment. In addition to the mating strategy, male body size significantly increased in the diatom treatment, hence average diameter of penis was also statistically different among the treatments (greater diameter in the S. hantzschii treatment). To examine the effect of algal food quality, we estimated quantity of fatty acids in the two algal species. Our result showed that S. hantzschii had a higher proportion of long‐chain PUFAs than C. vulgaris. Furthermore, a stable isotope analysis revealed that carbon and nitrogen originated from S. hantzschii were more assimilated to D. magna. In summary, our study manifested that diatom consumption of D. magna leads to more successful sexual reproduction. We then discussed how the diatom consumption of zooplankton influences food web dynamics in a freshwater ecosystem.},

	abstract = {SummaryLife table experiments were conducted on the generalist suspension feeder Daphnia galeata, using as food the two green algae (Chlorophyta) Scenedesmus acutus and Oocystis lacustris. Oocystis was hypothesized to be a lower quality food because it is convered with a thick sheath, believed to reduce digestibility. Results showed that Oocystis is a lower quality food for Daphnia, but only at relatively low food concentrations (0.15 mg C/L) and not at higher concentrations (1.0 mg C/L). At 0.15 mg C/L, Daphnia intrinsic rate of increase (r) when grown on Oocystis was only half that when grown on Scenedesmus. Daphnia r was similar at 0.15 mg C/L Oocystis and 0.075 mg C/L Scenedesmus, indicating that Daphnia requires twice as much Oocystis as Scenedesmus to achieve the same fitness. Intrinsic rate of increase was lower on Oocystis mainly because age at first reproduction was greatly delayed compared to that on Scenedesmus (13.6 vs 7.3 d). In addition, juvenile growth and survivorship were reduced on Oocystis compared with Scenedesmus. Clutch sizes were similar on the two foods, indicating that once individuals reached adulthood, the two foods were similar in quality. In contrast, at high food concentrations (1.0 mg C/L), the two algae were similar in quality for both juveniles and adults, and r was not significantly different on the two foods. Ingestion and assimilation rate experiments whowed that Daphnia consumes the two algae at identical rates, and that adults assimilate the two algae at similar rates. However, juveniles assimilate Oocystis at much lower rates than Scenedesmus, possibly accounting for reduced juvenile growth and delay in age at maturity at low concentrations. Thus, Daphnia exhibits an ontogenetic shift in its ability to utilize Oocystis, and this can result in “juvenile bottlenecks” in which survival and growth of young age classes are of critical importance in determining population dynamics. Because food quality effects were manifested primarily in juveniles and at low concentrations, food quality effects in nature will depend on phytoplankton abundance and age-structure of Daphnia populations.},

Erosion, salinization, and pollution are inducing a marked decline in agricultural productivity and loss of land and coastal lagoons at a time when the population is expanding exponentially. Geological analyses of radiocarbon-dated cores across the northern delta are used to interpret the interaction of sea-level changes, climatic oscillations, subsidence, and transport processes during the past 35,000 years.

Early efforts in irrigation water requirement computations in California and other arid and semiarid regions required the development of simplified ET equations for use with limited weather data. Several initial efforts were directed towards improving the usefulness of pan evaporation for estimating irrigation water requirements. Similarity with climates of other countries allowed developments in California to be extended overseas. Criticism of empirical methods by H. L. Penman and others encouraged the search for a robust and practical method that was based on readily available climatic data for computing potential evapotranspiration or reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo). One of these efforts ultimately culminated in the 1985 Hargreaves ETo method. The 1985 Hargreaves ETo method requires only measured temperature data, is simple, and appears to be less impacted than Penman-type methods when data are collected from arid or semiarid, nonirrigated sites. For irrigated sites, the Hargreaves 1985 ETo method produces values for periods of five or more days that compare favorably with those of the FAO Penman-Monteith and California Irrigation Management Information Services (CIMIS) Penman methods. The Hargreaves ETo predicted 0.97 of lysimeter measured ETo at Kimberly, Idaho after adjustment of lysimeter data for differences in surface conductance from the FAO Penman-Monteith definition. Monthly ETo by the 1985 Hargreaves equation compares closely with ETo calculated using a simplified, “reduced-set” Penman-Monteith that requires air temperature data only.},

	abstract = {A coastal wetland along Lake Erie (Ohio, U.S.A.) was studied to determine hydrologic and phosphorus budgets and spatial and temporal variation of phosphorus and related chemical parameters. The wetland was influenced by changing Lake Erie water levels, seiches, shifting shoreline sediments, and watershed inflow during a year of severe drought. The water budget for a 7-month period (March – September, 1988) had average inflow of 15 200 m3 day−1 from the watershed and 3.5 m3 day−1 from Lake Erie. The wetland increased in volume by 700 m3 day−1 despite a drought that resulted in 80\% more evapotranspiration than rainfall as a barrier beach isolated the wetland from Lake Erie for 77\% of the study period. Conductivity decreased by 34\% as water flowed through the wetland and turbidity and total suspended solids were variable and statistically similar at inflow and outflow. Average total phosphorus concentrations in the inflow and outflow were also similar (247 and 248 µg P l−1 respectively) although total soluble phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus decreased significantly (α=0.05) from inflow to outflow (averages 94 to 45 µg P l−1 and 7.5 to 4.0 µg P l−1 respectively). Nutrient budgets from field data estimate a retention of 36\% of the phosphorus, presumably in the sediments (0.8 mg P m−2 day−1). A general nutrient retention model, an estimated deposition rate from a sediment core and a simulation model predicted higher mass retention of phosphorus but similar percentage retention.SommaireUn marecage qui côtoie le lac Erie (USA) a servi de site expérimental pour en déterminer les budgets d'eau et de phosphore, de même que pour la variation spatiale et temporelle du phosphore et d'autres facteurs chimiques. Le marécage a été influencé par: niveaux d'eau qui changeaient; seiches; sédiments mouvants du littoral; et afflux de la ligne de partage des eaux dans une année de grande sécheresse. Le budget d'eau dans une période de 7 mois (mars–septembre 1988) montre un afflux de 15 200 m3 jour−1 de la ligne de partage, et 3.5 m3 jour−1 du lac Erie. Le volume du marécage a augmenté par 700 m3 jour−1 malgré une sécheresse qui a produit plus d'évapotranspiration (80\%) que de pluie pendant qu'une plage-obstacle a isolé le marecage du lac Erie pendant 77\% de la période d'observation. La conductivité a diminué par 34\% pendant que l'eau coulait, et la turbidité et les TSS ont varié, tout en démontrant des statistiques similaires à l'afflux et au déversement. Les moyennes pour les concentrations du total du phosphore à l'afflux et au déversement ont été similaires (247 and 248 µg P l−1), quoique le TSP et le SRP ont diminué (α=0.05) de l'afflux au déversement (donant des moyennes de 94 à 45 µg P l−1 et de 7.5 à 4.0 µg P l'−1). Les budgets de substances nutritives pour les données suggèrent une reténtion de 36\% du phosphore, évidemment dans les sédiments (0.8 mg P m−2 jour−1). Un modèle pour la rétention des nutrients, un taux de déposition, estimé par un noyau de sédiments, et une simulation avaient prédit un plus grand taux de rétention de phosphore, mais un pourcentage similaire pour la rétention.},

	abstract = {Historical changes (1961–2002) in the distribution of herbaceous wetland plant associations were inferred from the hydrological regime of Lake Saint-Pierre, a 312 km2 broadening of the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada), to assess the cumulative effects of human interventions and climatic variability. Relative abundance index (height × percent cover) of wetland plants in 630 field quadrats sampled at 13 sites (1999–2002) were used to derive a model predicting the occurrence of nine herbaceous plant classes with a 71\% (24–84\%) accuracy. Wetland types included seasonally dry (meadows), mudflats and wet (low marshes and submerged) assemblages. Over the 1961–2002 period, the total surface area of Lake Saint-Pierre herbaceous wetlands ranged between 11 (in 1972) and 128 (in 2001) km2 and was negatively correlated (Spearman r = −0.86, p {\textless} 0.0001) to average water level during the current growing season. Within-season variability and level conditions over the previous season defined 5 marsh assemblages characterized by different species composition, relative abundance and diversity. Significant hydrological variables included quadrat elevation, water depth, number of days flooded and depth variability experienced over the current and/or previous growth seasons. The hydrological model suggests that for a given level, wetland plant assemblages differed markedly whether the multi-year sequence of water levels was rising or falling. Lake Saint-Pierre alternated between three broad-scale wetland configurations, dominated by meadows and open marsh with floating-leaved vegetation (in the 1960s), scattered tall Scirpus marshes (in the 1970s and early 1980s) and closed marsh with aggressive emergents (since 1996). The strong response of Lake Saint-Pierre wetlands to hydrological conditions in the current and previous growth seasons underlines their vulnerability to future water level variations resulting from regulation and climate variability.},

	abstract = {Freshwater habitats occupy {\textless}1\% of the Earth's surface, yet are hotspots that support ∼10\% of all known species, and ∼⅓ of vertebrate species. Fresh waters also are hotspots for human activities that have led to widespread habitat degradation, pollution, flow regulation and water extraction, fisheries overexploitation, and alien species introductions. These impacts have caused severe declines in the range and abundance of many freshwater species, so that they are now far more imperiled than their marine or terrestrial counterparts. Here, we review progress in conservation of freshwater biodiversity, with a focus on the period since 1986, and outline key challenges for the future. Driven by rising conservation concerns, freshwater ecologists have conducted a great deal of research over the past 25 y on the status, trends, autecology, and propagation of imperiled species, threats to these species, the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning, metapopulation dynamics, biodiversity hotspots, reserve design, habitat restoration, communication with stakeholders, and weaknesses of protective legislation. Nevertheless, existing efforts might be insufficient to stem the ongoing and coming multitude of freshwater extinctions. We briefly discuss 4 important challenges for freshwater conservation. First, climate change will imperil both freshwater species and human uses of fresh water, driving engineering responses that will further threaten the freshwater biota. We need to anticipate both ecological and human responses to climate change, and to encourage rational and deliberate planning of engineering responses to climate change before disasters strike. Second, because freshwater extinctions are already well underway, freshwater conservationists must be prepared to act now to prevent further losses, even if our knowledge is incomplete, and engage more effectively with other stakeholders. Third, we need to bridge the gap between freshwater ecology and conservation biology. Fourth, we suggest that scientific societies and scholarly journals concerned with limnology or freshwater sciences need to improve their historically poor record in publishing important papers and influencing practice in conservation ecology. Failure to meet these challenges will lead to the extinction or impoverishment of the very subjects of our research.},

We find that nearly 80\% of the world’s population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65\% of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Allelochemical interactions among aquatic macrophytes and between macrophytes and attached microbial assemblages (epiphyton) influence a number of ecological processes. The ecological importance of these interactions, however, is poorly understood; we hypothesize that paucity has resulted, in part, from (1) a narrow focus on exploration for herbicidal plant products from aquatic macrophytes, (2) the difficulties in distinguishing resource competition from allelopathic interference, and (3) a predominance of approaching aquatic allelopathy from a terrestrial perspective. Based upon recent thorough investigations of allelopathy among aquatic vascular plants, chemical compounds that influence competitive interactions among littoral organisms are amphiphilic compounds that tend to remain near the producing organism (e.g., polyphenolic compounds and volatile fatty acids). Production of these compounds may be influenced by relative availability of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), inorganic carbon, and light. Macrophyte strategies of clonal reproduction, in an effort to persist in these highly productive and competitive habitats, have contributed to reduced reliance upon sexual reproduction that is correlated with allelopathic autotoxicity among several dominant wetland plant species. Although few studies document the importance of allelochemical interactions in the wetland and littoral zones of aquatic ecosystems, abundant evidence supports the potential for significant effects on competition and community structure; effects of altered nutrient ratios and availability on plant chemical composition; and resultant effects on trophic interactions, particularly suppression of herbivory, competitive attached algae and cyanobacteria, and heterotrophic utilization of organic matter by bacteria and fungi.},

However, in the 1990s, phytoplankton biomass increased again, almost reaching the high values recorded during the period of greatest P loading. The structural changes in the phytoplankton of Lake Geneva over the past 25 yr have been analyzed using a recently developed statistical method based on hierarchical clustering and Bayesian probabilities. This method has been used to identify phytoplankton assemblages and to map annual and interannual successional patterns simultaneously. Characteristic species were identified for each cluster after calculation of their relative species fidelity and specificity indices. Six distinct phytoplankton assemblages were identified, and although the way species are organized into communities remains unclear, the seasonal patterns of succession are consistent with the C-S-R adaptive strategies and are characteristic of temperate lakes. This pattern broadly recurred over the years, but was markedly influenced by both human activity and regional climatic changes: The warmer winters and springs recorded in Europe since 1988 led to an earlier clear-water phase. In the 1990s, the earlier and deeper depletion of dissolved inorganic phosphorus led to colonization in the summer by large species tolerant of low light levels and that could develop deeper in the water column, where phosphorus was still abundant. Their size made them less vulnerable to grazing losses, which favors their accumulation and lead to an unexpected high biomass in recent years.},

Thermal stability declined within hours in all systems following passage of Irene, and the magnitude of change was related to the volume of water falling on the lake and catchment relative to lake volume. Across systems, temperature change predicted the change in primary production, but changes in mixed-layer thickness did not affect metabolism. Instead, respiration became a driver of ecosystem metabolism that was decoupled from in-lake primary production, likely due to addition of terrestrially derived carbon. Regionally, energetic disturbance of thermal structure was shorter-lived than disturbance from inflows of terrestrial materials. Given predicted regional increases in intense rain events with climate change, the magnitude and longevity of ecological impacts of these storms will be greater in systems with large catchments relative to lake volume, particularly when significant material is available for transport from the catchment. This case illustrates the power of automated sensor networks and associated human networks in assessing both system response and the characteristics that mediate physical and ecological responses to extreme events.},

	abstract = {1. Weather-related episodic events are typically unpredictable, and their duration is often short. Abiotic and biological responses are often missed in routine monitoring. These responses are, however, now of particular relevance given projected changes in extreme weather conditions. 2. We present data from high-frequency monitoring stations from lakes in Europe, North America and Asia that illustrate two classes of abiotic effects of weather events: (i) generally short-lived effects of storms on lake thermal structure and (ii) the more prolonged effects of high rainfall events on dissolved organic matter levels and water clarity. We further relate these abiotic effects to changes in dissolved oxygen or in chlorophyll a levels. 3. Three differing causes for weather-related decreases in surface dissolved oxygen levels were observed: (i) entrainment of anoxic water from depth, (ii) reduction in primary productivity and (iii) increased mineralisation of organic carbon delivered from the catchment. 4. The duration of in-lake effects tended to be longer for events driven by weather conditions with a longer return period, that is, conditions that were relatively more severe and less frequent at a site. While the susceptibility of lakes to change was related in part to the severity of the meteorological drivers, the impacts also depended on site-specific factors in some cases. 5. The availability of high-frequency data at these sites provided insight into the capacity of the lakes to absorb current and future pressures. Several of the changes we observed, including increases in carbon availability, decreases in photosynthetically active radiation and increased disturbance, have the capacity to shift lakes towards an increased degree of heterotrophy. The magnitude and direction of any such change will, however, also depend on the magnitude and direction of climate change for a given location and on lake and catchment characteristics.},

However, many traditional ecosystem models are tailored for specific regions or ecosystem types, requiring several regional models to predict the same function. Alternatively, trait-based approaches have been effectively used to predict community structure in both terrestrial and aquatic environments and ecosystem function in a limited number of terrestrial examples. Here, we test the efficacy of a trait-based model in predicting gross primary production (GPP) in lake ecosystems. We incorporated data from {\textgreater}1000 United States lakes along with laboratory-generated phytoplankton trait data to build a trait-based model of GPP and then validated the model with GPP observations from a separate set of globally distributed lakes. The trait-based model performed as well as or outperformed two ecosystem models both spatially and temporally, demonstrating the efficacy of trait-based models for predicting ecosystem function over a range of environmental conditions.},

We present a “toolbox for philosophical dialogue,” consisting of a set of questions for self-examination that cross-disciplinary collaborators can use to identify and address their philosophical disparities and commonalities.

We devised a freshwater medium, named COMBO, that supports excellent growth of both algae and zooplankton. Two types of algae, Ankistrodesmus falcatus and Stephanodiscus hantzschii, were reared in COMBO and their growth rates were not significantly different from those of algae grown in a reference medium (WC). One of these algae, A. falcatus, was then fed to a cladoceran, Daphnia pulicaria, which was also cultured in COMBO, and the resulting fecundities of D. pulicaria were compared to those of animals reared in natural surface water. We also determined whether the value of COMBO as a medium for D. pulicaria was affected by modifications in nitrogen or phosphorus concentration to evaluate whether the new medium will be useful in nutritional research. Lowering the N or P content of COMBO did not affect the reproductive performance of D. pulicaria. Other researchers have also reported excellent growth and reproduction by numerous algae and zooplankton reared in COMBO. Our results suggest that COMBO is an effective artificial, defined culture medium capable of supporting robust growth and reproduction of both freshwater algae and zooplankton.},

	abstract = {A change in the use of spawning habitats linked with water-level management may explain differences in reproductive success among sympatric St. Lawrence River northern pike Esox lucius and muskellunge Esox masquinongy. Reproductive success in a shared spawning and nursery bay was compared based on egg (embryo) and age-0 abundance estimates before the fall emigration of young. Historically, northern pike were noted to commence spawning runs in shallow flooded areas soon after ice-out. I found that more than 87\% of the estimated northern pike egg deposition in 1994 occurred in offshore, deep-water habitats (2-5 m) and that 99\%, did in 1995. Northern pike began spawning 17 d before muskellunge in 1994 and 31 d earlier in 1995. Spawning peaks occurred during the interval of 16-23 May. Muskellunge mostly spawned near shore ({\textless} 1.5-m depth) in submerged aquatic vegetation growth that was absent during northern pike spawning. Muskellunge spawning began and peaked between 23 May and 4 June in 1994 and between 23 May and 1 June in 1995. Estimated egg deposition by northern pike was over 40 times that of muskellunge for the 2 years combined. Despite greater egg deposition, minimum survival estimates of northern pike from egg to fall juvenile were very low: 0.00008\% in 1994 and 0.00010\% in 1995. By comparison, minimum muskellunge survival estimates (egg to fall juvenile) were greater: 0.034\% in 1994 and 0.105\% in 1995. In seine surveys age-0 muskellunge catch per unit effort was negatively correlated with that of northern pike (r = -0.77), and muskellunge dominated catches for 9 of 10 years sampled. Growth of inshore submergent habitat during muskellunge spawning and the low abundance of northern pike may have contributed to the greater reproductive success of muskellunge.},

Analysis of data from temperature arrays deployed on the lake from 1998 to 2007 showed that as mean summer temperatures shifted from 2.5°C below the mean, to the mean, and to 3°C above the mean, deepening of the mixed layer during cold fronts decreased, average metalimnetic thickness increased from 2 to 5 m, maximum values of water-column stability increased fourfold, minimum values of Lake numbers (LN) increased from ≤1 to 10, the metalimnetic coefficient of eddy diffusivity (Kz) decreased from 10−5 m2 s−1 to 10−7 m2 s−1, and time scales for mixing across the metalimnion increased from days to months. Mean surface temperatures and mixing regimes were significantly correlated with mean air temperatures, but not with mean insolation, or mean wind speeds during summer. They also depended upon the frequency and persistence of events with higher winds, heating, or cooling. In summers with cold surface temperatures, the surface energy fluxes that induce mixing by heat loss were low but with frequent wind events heat was mixed downwards, leading to lower stability. The warmest surface temperatures resulted when atmospheric conditions led to persistent positive buoyancy flux in early summer and winds were elevated primarily on diel cycles as opposed to longer ones. Summers with cooler water temperatures and enhanced vertical mixing are linked to frontal activity and low atmospheric pressure near the northern Alaskan coast.},

	abstract = {During the ice-free period in the Arctic, the thermal structure and mixing dynamics of small lakes change with the passing of air masses. In Toolik Lake, Alaska, stable warm air masses during the ice-free season were associated with lake warming, daily winds were maximally 4–7 m s−1 for less than 12 h duration, lake numbers (LN) varied daily between 2 and 80, and values of the coefficient of vertical eddy diffusivity ranged from molecular to 10−6 m2 s−1. For the 3-week warming period following ice-off, vertical mixing, which occurred primarily near the lake's sloping boundaries, supplied inorganic nitrogen only to phytoplankton in the chlorophyll maxima and only at rates sufficient to support 10–22\% of their daily needs. In the upper water column, chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity decreased by a factor of three relative to the maximum at ice-off. In contrast, during transitions between warm and cold air masses or the converse, wind speeds exceeded 5 m s−1 for over 1 d and LN decreased to values of 3 or lower for periods of 1–2 d. In consequence, turbulence increased by one to two orders of magnitude, dispersing the chlorophyll maximum into multiple layers and increasing solute concentrations in hypolimnetic waters. Increased precipitation accompanied cold air masses, and in one case stream discharge of {\textasciitilde}30 times base flow led initially to an overflow and subsequently to a metalimnetic intrusion with loading of inorganic nitrogen 10 times the daily needs of phytoplankton. Overall, the frequency with which frontal systems moved through the region determined the temporal variance in nutrient supply. Spatial variability within the lake was generated by the degree of penetration of incoming streams and the vertical layering of intrusions. These temporal events and the layers induced are hot spots of activity important for sustaining growth in oligotrophic lakes.},

	abstract = {Fish can become stranded when water levels decrease, often rapidly, as a result of anthropogenic (e.g., canal drawdown, hydropeaking, vessel wakes) and natural (e.g., floods, drought, winter ice dynamics) events. We summarize existing research on stranding of fish in freshwater, discuss the sources, consequences, and mitigation options for stranding, and report current knowledge gaps. Our literature review revealed that similar to 65.5\% of relevant peer-reviewed articles were found to focus on stranding associated with hydropower operations and irrigation projects. In fact, anthropogenic sources of fish stranding represented 81.8\% of available literature compared to only 19.9\% attributed to natural fish stranding events. While fish mortality as a result of stranding is well documented, our analysis revealed that little is known about the sublethal and long-term consequences of stranding on growth and population dynamics. Furthermore, the contribution of stranding to annual mortality rates is poorly understood as are the potential ecosystem-scale impacts. Mitigation strategies available to deal with stranding include fish salvage, ramping rate limitations, and physical habitat works (e.g., to contour substrate to minimize stranding). However, a greater knowledge of the factors that cause fish stranding would promote the development and refinement of mitigation strategies that are economically and ecologically sustainable.

	abstract = {Aquatic vegetation in the relatively pristine coastal wetlands of eastern Georgian Bay provides critical habitat for a diverse fish community. Declining water levels in Lake Huron over the past decade, however, have altered the wetland plant assemblages in favour of terrestrial (emergent and meadow) taxa and have thus reduced or eliminated this important ecosystem service. In this study, we compared IKONOS satellite images for two regions of eastern Georgian Bay (acquired in 2002 and 2008) to determine significant changes in cover of four distinct wetland vegetation groups [meadow (M), emergent (E), high-density floating (HD) and low-density floating (LD)] over the 6years. While LD decreased significantly (mean -2995.4m2), M and HD increased significantly (mean +2020.9m2 and +2312.6m(2), respectively) between 2002 and 2008. Small patches of LD had been replaced by larger patches of HD. These results show that sustained low water levels have led to an increasingly homogeneous habitat and an overall net loss of fish habitat. A comparison of the fish communities sampled between 2003 and 2005 with those sampled in 2009 revealed that there was a significant decline in species richness. The remaining fish communities were also more homogeneous. We suggest that the observed changes in the wetland plant community due to prolonged low water levels may have resulted in significant changes in the fish communities of coastal wetlands in eastern Georgian Bay.},

	abstract = {The invasion of North American wetlands by the Eurasian subspecies of common reed Phragmites australis australis is well documented, but very few studies have been conducted on its effects on freshwater fish communities. Northern Pike Esox lucius is one of several fish species using wetlands for reproduction and early development that could be affected by the spread of common reed. The effects of vegetation type (common reed stands, other reference plant assemblages) were evaluated on four aspects (egg deposition, abundance, growth, and feeding) of the early life history of Northern Pike in two St. Lawrence River wetlands in Quebec. During high water levels in 2009, the relative abundance of Northern Pike eggs was three times higher in the reference plant assemblages than in the common reed stands at the two study sites. In 2010, when water levels were extremely low and few other plant assemblages were accessible by fish, the relative abundance of eggs was two times higher in the common reed stands than in other plant assemblages within the only site available for sampling. In 2009, the relative abundance, length, and weight of age-0 Northern Pike did not differ significantly between common reed stands and reference assemblages. Growth rate, condition, prey type, and relationship between digestive tract dry weight and total fish dry weight suggested slightly more favorable conditions in common reed stands in some cases or in reference assemblages in other cases (no consistent pattern between the vegetation types). Although common reed is still in the early invasion process in St. Lawrence River freshwater marshes, it does not seem to have any negative effects on Northern Pike early life history. However, little is known about the magnitude of common reed biomass accumulation, making it impossible to predict whether these stands, which are part of an ongoing invasion, will provide long-term quality habitat.},

The balanced sampling design provided a broad picture of the warm, cool and coldwater fish community inhabiting open-coastal waters out to about 30m water depth. Catch results were summarized by geographic area and depth strata to describe species distribution patterns, and presented graphically to illustrate annual abundance trends of the most important fish species (Alewife, Lake Trout, Yellow Perch, Walleye, Round Goby, Lake Whitefish, Brown Trout, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Chinook Salmon, Burbot, Cisco and Round Whitefish). Many of these dominant species showed peak abundance levels in the early 1990 s followed by decline. Of particular note, members of the coldwater benthic-oriented species assemblage, having all declined dramatically in the 1990s, remain at very low abundance levels, and their future prognosis appears bleak.},

Quatrefoil light traps fished at night were used to sample larval northern pike in 11 potential nursery areas. Larval northern pike were most commonly sampled among floating-leaf burreed Sparganium fluctuans, common burreed Sparganium eurycarpum, sedges Carex spp., hybrid cattail Typhaxglauca and wild rice Zizania palustris. A negative binomial model of light-trap catches using the presence/absence data for 2012 from all 11 bays included water elevation and the presence of cattail as significant variables. Ultimately, the species of vegetation may not be as important as the physical quality or form of the vegetation in supplying feeding and hiding cover. The aquatic plant species and structural forms encountered by larval northern pike suggest they use nearly any vegetated cover available in early spring. Water-level regulations that change availability of aquatic vegetation are likely to influence recruitment of northern pike to larger sizes.},

	abstract = {Studies in estuaries on the French Atlantic coast, with tides ranging from 4 to 7 m, have shown that in macrotidal estuaries, semidiurnal and fortnightly tidal cycles play a significant role in controlling hydrological and sedimentological processes. During the fortnightly neap-spring cycle of tidal amplitudes, the tidal prism varies considerably, bringing about significant changes in the ratio of river flow to tidal volume. This in turn causes large variations in mixing, and the estuaries can change from a relatively well mixed state during spring tides, to partially mixed, or even well stratified, during neap tides. The changes in the tidal averaged water volume of the estuaries during the neap-spring sequence induces a residual accumulation of water in the estuary during increasing tide range and a residual seaward discharge during decreasing tide range. This purely tidal effect can probably influence the flow of fresh water and suspended sediment seaward from the estuary. During every semidiurnal tidal cycle, large amounts of fine sediment are alternatingly eroded, resuspended and deposited, and the turbidity maximum in these estuaries appears as essentially a tide-induced phenomenon. Upstream transport of suspended sediment caused by the ebb-flood asymmetry of the shoaling tidal wave appears to create a tidal sediment trap in the upper estuary, even in the absence of density circulation. Neap–spring tide cycles control sedimentation and seaward escape of suspended sediment. Large-scale erosion and resuspension occurs during spring tides, increasing the residence time of fine sediment in the aquatic environment, and providing a mechanism for enhancing seaward escape of suspended sediment. In hypersynchronous estuaries, where tidal damping by friction is less than the effect of the upstream convergence, tidal amplitude and power dissipation can attain a maximum within the estuary. Numerical simulation of suspended sediment in the Gironde estuary shows that this process also contributes to the formation of the turbidity maximum.},

The aboveground and total biomass of macrophytes were related to a variety of environmental variables as follows in descending order of importance: exposure to wind and waves, plant growth forms, water depth, and light intensity. Together, these variables accounted for 67 and 74\% of sampling variability of aboveground and total biomass, respectively. These environmental Variables were used to elaborate hierarchical predictive models of aboveground and total biomass of emergent and submerged macrophytes.

	abstract = {A global hydrological routing algorithm (HYDRA) that simulates seasonal river discharge and changes in surface water level on a spatial resolution of 5' long x 5' lat is presented. The model is based an previous work by M. T. Coe and incorporates major improvements from that work including 1) the ability to simulate monthly and seasonal variations in discharge and lake and wetland level, and 2) direct representation of man-made dams and reservoirs. HYDRA requires as input daily or monthly mean averages of runoff, precipitation, and evaporation either from GCM output or observations. As an example of the utility of HYDRA in evaluating GCM simulations, the model is forced with monthly mean estimates of runoff from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis dataset. The simulated river discharge clearly shows that although the NCEP runoff captures the large-scale features of the observed terrestrial hydrology, there are numerous differences in detail from observations. The simulated mean annual discharge is within +/-20\% at only 13 of 90 fluvial gauging stations compared. In general, the discharge is overestimated for most of the northern high latitudes, midcontinental North America, eastern Europe. central and eastern Asia, India, and northern Africa. Only in western Europe and eastern North America is the discharge consistently underestimated. Although there appears to be a need for improved simulation of land surface physics in the NCEP product and parameterization of how velocities within HYDRA, the timing of the monthly mean discharge is in fair agreement with the observations. Including lakes within HYDRA reduces the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of discharge and the magnitude of the annual mean discharge of the St. Lawrence River system, in qualitative agreement with the observations. In addition, including the wetlands of the Sudd reduces the magnitude of the simulated annual discharge of the Nile River to values in better agreement with observations. Finally, the impact of man-made dams and their reservoirs on the magnitude of monthly mean discharge can be explicitly included within HYDRA. As an example, including darns and reservoirs on the Parana River improves the agreement of the simulated mean monthly discharge with observations by reducing the amplitude of the seasonal cycle to values in good agreement with the observations. The results of this study show that, although improvements can be obtained through better representations of flow velocities and more accurate digital elevation models. HYDRA can be a powerful tool for diagnosing simulated terrestrial hydrology and investigations of global climate change.},

	abstract = {The Quebec Water Policy was launched in November 2002 in support of reform of the water governance. One of the government commitments is to gradually implement watershed-based management for 33 major watercourses located primarily in the St. Lawrence plain. At the local and regional levels, watershed organizations are responsible for implementing integrated management, from a sustainable-development perspective, by preparing a master plan for water (MPW), which will include watercourses, lakes, wetlands and aquifers. These watershed organizations rely on public consultation, as well as local and regional expertise, on the responsibilities for water of the municipalities and regional county municipalities of the territory, as well as those of the ministries and other government agencies. They are also required to observe national priorities regarding protection, restoration, and development of water resources and to comply with relevant guidelines, directives, standards, regulations, and legislation.

The role of watershed organizations is to act as planning and consultation tables. Government representatives are present, on the initial process, as the facilitator and for scientific and technical support. They do not have, at this moment, any voting or decisional rights. After two years, integrated water management mobilized water stakeholders on watersheds and they are on their way to initiating their first MPW.},

	abstract = {Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River (LOSL) wetland bird abundance and diversity are greatly influenced by lake and river hydrology. Our study used an interdisciplinary ecosystem approach, blending avian and plant ecology, ecohydraulic, statistical ecology and modelling to evaluate potential impacts of water level fluctuations on indicator species representative of the wetland breeding bird assemblages in the entire LOSL freshwater system. Multi-year (2000–2003) bird surveys captured bird distribution and density in wetland habitats under varying degrees of water inandation, depth and fluctuation. Analyses revealed strong associations between estimated breeding pair densities and plant communities, water depth, and degree of water level fluctuation during the breeding season for a suite of wetland bird species using marsh, wet meadow, shrub swamp and treed swamp habitats. These quantitative associations were used to develop wetland bird performance indicators for use in a LOSL water regulation review study. Several bird species also nest at or near the water surface and are thus vulnerable to nest flooding or stranding. Changes to the seasonal hydrology of Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River that result in an increased frequency or magnitude of these nest failure events may have a significant impact on regional population sustainability. Long term nest record databases were analyzed to create nesting flooding and stranding probability equations based on water level increases and decreases during the breeding season. These species-specific nesting relationships were incorporated into a reproduction index.Many breeding bird species were strongly associated with specific wetland plant communities. Predicted habitat suitability, as measured by estimated breeding pair density, can also change significantly within a specific wetland plant community based solely on changes in water depth during the breeding season. Three indicator species, Black Tern, Least Bittern and Virginia Rail were selected as key environmental performance indicators for alternate regulation plan comparisons.Water regulation criteria should be such that the long term diversity and abundance of wetland plant communities and frequency of spring flooding in marsh habitats during breeding are not reduced. Magnitude and frequency of water level change during the nesting season (May–July) can also adversely impact reproductive success of many wetland bird species. As such, regulation criteria that increase the seasonal magnitude and frequency of water level change may be detrimental to the long term viability of certain regional breeding bird populations.},

	abstract = {Relative contributions by macrophytes, epiphyton and phytoplankton to total primary production was estimated in a large (∼300 km2) widening of the St. Lawrence River (Canada), over a 2-year period with contrasting flows and water levels. Spatially-explicit estimates of whole-system production were obtained by combining field measurements with remotely sensed data and empirical models using GIS. Primary production and relative contributions of each producer type differed markedly between open-water and wetland habitats. Spatial differences within each habitat arose from interactions between physical factors including light, water depth, water transit times and wind stress. At the whole-system level, annual primary production represented 105 gC m−2 y−1, divided roughly equally among phytoplankton (34\%), submerged macrophytes (27\%), emergent macrophytes (23\%) and epiphyton (16\%). A 10\% decrease in annual flows and 1-m decline in water levels between 2000 and 2001 resulted in a 50\% loss of marsh habitat, a 60\% increase in phytoplankton production in the open-water zone, and in the appearance of conspicuous filamentous algal mats. Low water levels induced substantial shifts in the spatial configuration and relative importance of primary producers although total river primary production remained stable between years.},

	abstract = {Photointerpretation studies were conducted to evaluate vegetation changes in wetlands of Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River associated with regulation of water levels since about 1960. The studies used photographs from 16 sites (four each from drowned river mouth, barrier beach, open embayment, and protected embayment wetlands) and spanned a period from the 1950s to 2001 at roughly decadal intervals. Meadow marsh was the most prominent vegetation type in most wetlands in the late 1950s when water levels had declined following high lake levels in the early 1950s. Meadow marsh increased at some sites in the mid-1960s in response to low lake levels and decreased at all sites in the late 1970s following a period of high lake levels. Typha increased at nearly all sites, except wave-exposed open embayments, in the 1970s. Meadow marsh continued to decrease and Typha to increase at most sites during sustained higher lake levels through the 1980s, 1990s, and into 2001. Most vegetation changes could be correlated with lake-level changes and with life-history strategies and physiological tolerances to water depth of prominent taxa. Analyses of GIS coverages demonstrated that much of the Typha invasion was landward into meadow marsh, largely by Typha × glauca. Lesser expansion toward open water included both T. × glauca and T. angustifolia. Although many models focus on the seed bank as a key component of vegetative change in wetlands, our results suggest that canopy-dominating, moisture-requiring Typha was able to invade meadow marsh at higher elevations because sustained higher lake levels allowed it to survive and overtake sedges and grasses that can tolerate periods of drier soil conditions.},

Although climate conditions in 2003 and 2004 were nearly identical, large differences in streamflow were observed downstream from the Matawin dam. These differences resulted in numerous days without flow (no water release) during the growing period (May to August) in 2003, leading to man-made hydrological drought. While this drought had no effect on abiotic variables (grain-size distribution and nutrient concentrations in sediments), a significant decrease in the number of terrestrial species was observed in 2004 (year without drought) relative to 2003 (drought year) on three sand bars studied. This decrease is interpreted to result from prolonged submergence of the sites in 2004. Principal component analysis highlighted the effect of individual sites (first principal component) and of the interannual variability of streamflow (second component) on the number of species. The study suggests that, from a flow management standpoint, it is advisable to release enough water downstream from the dam during the growing season to prevent low-flow channel colonization by invasive terrestrial species.},

	abstract = {The relationships between the results of Beijing International Marathon Races and the corresponding weather conditions are analysed quantitatively. There are obvious interrelationships between the marathon results and weather factors such as air temperature, wet bulb temperature and human biometeorological indices. For example, the correlation coefficient between the average times of the top ten finishers and temperature is r = 0.8910. The meteorological conditions are classified into three categories, suitable, moderate and unsuitable for running a marathon race, and the optimum meteorological index is given. Also the concept of a meteorological result, i.e. the part of the actual performances fluctuating with the changes in weather conditions, is presented. This plays an important role in some kinds of sports such as marathon racing. Finally, the results of physiological tests are given, which illustrate the physiological reactions of long- and middle-distance runners to the surrounding temperature.},

	abstract = {Marathon running performance slows in warm weather conditions, but the quantitative impact of weather has not been established.
PURPOSE: To quantify the impact of weather on marathon performance for different populations of runners.
METHODS: Marathon results and weather data were obtained for the Boston, New York, Twin Cities, Grandma's, Richmond, Hartford, and Vancouver Marathons for 36, 29, 24, 23, 6, 12, and 10 yr, respectively. The race results were broken into quartiles based on the wet-bulb globe temperature (Q1 5.1-10 degrees C, Q2 10.1-15 degrees C, Q3 15.1-20 degrees C, and Q4 20.1-25 degrees C). Analysis of the top three male and female finishers as well as the 25th-, 50th-, 100th-, and 300th-place finishers were compared with the course record and then contrasted with weather.
RESULTS: Marathon performances of top males were slower than the course record by 1.7 +/- 1.5, 2.5 +/- 2.1, 3.3 +/- 2.0, and 4.5 +/- 2.3\% (mean +/- SD) for Q1-Q4, respectively. Differences between Q4 and Q1, Q2, and between Q3, and Q1 were statistically different (P {\textless} 0.05). The top women followed a similar trend (Q1 3.2 +/- 4.9, Q2 3.2 +/- 2.9, Q3 3.8 +/- 3.2, and Q4 5.4 +/- 4.1\% (mean +/- SD)), but the differences among quartiles were not statistically significant. The 25th-, 50th-, 100th-, and 300th-place finishers slowed more than faster runners as WBGT increased. For all runners, equivalence testing around a 1\% indifference threshold suggests potentially important changes among quartiles independently of statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: There is a progressive slowing of marathon performance as the WBGT increases from 5 to 25 degrees C. This seems true for men and women of wide ranging abilities, but performance is more negatively affected for slower populations of runners.},

We evaluate the recognition results of gray deep features and color deep features, and explore the fusion of multimodal texture features. For the continuous facial expression recognition, we design two temporal-spatial dense scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features and combine multimodal features to recognize expression from image sequences. For the static facial expression recognition based on video frames, we extract dense SIFT and some deep convolutional neural network (CNN) features, including our proposed CNN architecture. We train linear support vector machine and partial least squares classifiers for those kinds of features on the static facial expression in the wild (SFEW) and acted facial expression in the wild (AFEW) dataset, and we propose a fusion network to combine all the extracted features at decision level. The final achievement we gained is 56.32\% on the SFEW testing set and 50.67\% on the AFEW validation set, which are much better than the baseline recognition rates of 35.96\% and 36.08\%.

	abstract = {Paddy fields irrigated using water from the Shinkawa River in Niigata, Japan, are subject to adverse effects associated with the occurrence of saltwater wedges in the river. The extent of saltwater intrusion in the river varies, depending on river discharge and tidal amplitude. In this study, field observations and numerical simulation of the Shinkawa River estuary were applied to ascertain the influence of saltwater wedges on paddy cultivation during the irrigation period. The saltwater wedge was surveyed using an echo-sounding profiling system (SC-3); results indicated that the longitudinal profiles of the saltwater wedge were 4.7 and 2.2 km from the river mouth sluice gate at the high water mark of spring tide and at the low water mark of neap tide, respectively. According to the vertical profiling using electrical conductivity (EC) meters at bridges crossing the river, there was a rigid interface between freshwater and saltwater with a thin halocline zone of approximately 0.25 m. These profiles were well reproduced by the one-dimensional, two-layer, unsteady flow model. The results of the model simulation and EC observation indicate that when the vertical position of the halocline rises to 1.2 m below the inlet of the water intake pumping station, the EC value rises sharply to 1,500 μs/cm, which is an unsuitable level for irrigation water. It is estimated that for about 23 \% of the total irrigation period, pump operation is halted as a result of this mechanism.},

The present note summarizes a small series of tests of one objective estimation scheme identical in form to the normal-ratio method of Paulhus and Kohler but applied here to missing seasonal totals rather than to missing storm totals. The results suggest that estimation errors in the neighborhood of 25 pct must be expected in estimating seasonal totals using two index stations under conditions typical of those forced upon the investigator dealing with older records. Increasing the number of index stations beyond two does not seem warranted. Errors of 25 pct in seasonal totals, though not negligible, are small enough compared to coefficients of variation typical of seasonal totals of precipitation in the drier portions of the United States, that the use of such a method in climatic studies is desirable.},

	abstract = {All vegetation on Watershed 2 of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest was cut during November and December of 1965, and vegetation regrowth was inhibited for two years by periodic application of herbicides. Annual stream—flow was increased 33 cm or 39\% the first year and 27 cm or 28\% the second year above the values expected if the watershed were not deforested. Large increases in streamwater concentration were observed for all major ions, except NH4+, SO4 = and HCO3—, approximately five months after the deforestation. Nitrate concentrations were 41—fold higher than the undisturbed condition the first year and 56—fold higher the second. The nitrate concentration in stream water has exceeded, almost continuously, the health levels recommended for drinking water. Sulfate was the only major ion in stream water that decreased in concentration after deforestation. An inverse relationship between sulfate and nitrate concentrations in stream water was observed in both undisturbed and deforested situations. Average streamwater concentrations increased by 417\% for Ca++, 408\% for Mg++, 1558\% for K+ and 177\% for Na+ during the two years subsequent to deforestation. Budgetary net losses from Watershed 2 in kg/ha—yr were about 142 for NO3—N, 90 for Ca++, 36 for K+, 32 for SiO2—Si, 24 for Al+++, 18 for Mg++, 17 for Na+, 4 for Cl—, and 0 for SO4—S during 1967—68; whereas for an adjacent, undisturbed watershed (W6) net losses were 9.2 for Ca++, 1.6 for K+, 17 for SiO2—Si, 3.1 for A1+++, 2.6 for Mg++, 7.0 for Na+, 0.1 for C1—, and 3.3 for SO4—S. Input of nitrate—nitrogen in precipitation normally exceeds the output in drainage water in the undisturbed ecosystems, and ammonium—nitrogen likewise accumulates in both the undisturbed and deforested ecosystems. Total gross export of dissolved solids, exclusive of organic matter, was about 75 metric tons/km2 in 1966—67, and 97 metric tons/km2 in 1967—68, or about 6 to 8 times greater than would be expected for an undisturbed watershed. The greatly increased export of dissolved nutrients from the deforested ecosystem was due to an alteration of the nitrogen cycle within the ecosystem. The drainage streams tributary to Hubbard Brook are normally acid, and as a result of deforestation the hydrogen ion content increased by 5—fold (from pH 5.1 to 4.3). Streamwater temperatures after deforestation were higher than the undisturbed condition during both summer and winter. Also in contrast to the relatively constant temperature in the undisturbed streams, streamwater temperature after deforestation fluctuated 3—4°C during the day in summer. Electrical conductivity increased about 6—fold in the stream water after deforestation and was much more variable. Increased streamwater turbidity as a result of the deforestation was negligible, however the particulate matter output was increased about 4—fold. Whereas the particulate matter is normally 50\% inorganic materials, after deforestation preliminary estimates indicate that the proportion of inorganic materials increased to 76\% of the total particulates. Supersaturation of dissolved oxygen in stream water from the experimental watersheds is common in all seasons except summer when stream discharge is low. The percent saturation is dependent upon flow rate in the streams. Sulfate, hydrogen ion and nitrate are major constituents in the precipitation. It is suggested that the increase in average nitrate concentration in precipitation compared to data from 1955—56,as well as the consistent annual increase observed from 1964 to 1968, may be some measure of a general increase in air pollution.},

During the study period (March 1981 to March 1982), dramatic changes in water—borne nutrient loads occurred in the riparian forest of the watershed. From surface runoff waters that had transited °50 m of riparian forest, an estimated 4.1 Mg of particulates, 11 kg of particulate organic—N, 0.83 kg of ammonium—N, 2.7 kg of nitrate—N and 3.0 kg of total particulate—P per ha of riparian forest were removed during the study year. In addition, an estimated removal of 45 kg°ha—1°yr—1 of nitrate N occurred in subsurface flow as it moved through the riparian zone. Nutrient uptake rates for the cropland are riparian forest were estimated. These systems were then compared with respect to their pathways of nutrient flow and ability to retain nutrients. The cropland appeared to retain fewer nutrients than the riparian forest and is thought to incur the majority of its nutrient losses in harvested crop. The dominant pathway of total—N loss from the riparian forest seemed to be subsurface flux. Total phosphorus loss from the riparian forest appeared almost evenly divided between surface and subsurface losses. Nutrient removals in the riparian forest and thought to be of ecological significance to receiving waters and indicate that coupling natural systems and managed habitats within a watershed may reduce diffuse—source pollution.},

NEWS models estimate export from 5761 watersheds globally as a function of land use, nutrient inputs, hydrology, and other factors; regional and global scale patterns as of 1995 are presented here. Watershed sources and their relative magnitudes differ by element and form. For example, anthropogenic sources dominate the export of DIN and DIP at the global scale, although their anthropogenic sources differ significantly (diffuse and point, respectively). Natural sources dominate DON and DOP export globally, although diffuse anthropogenic sources dominate in several regions in Asia, Europe and N. America. “Hot spots” where yield (kg km−2 yr−1) is high for several elements and forms were identified, including parts of Indonesia, Japan, southern Asia, and Central America, due to anthropogenic N and P inputs in some regions and high water runoff in others. NEWS models provide a tool to examine past, current and future river export of nutrients, and how humans might impact element ratios and forms, and thereby affect estuaries and coastal seas.},

Nutrient input to the Laurentian Great Lakes continues to cause problems with eutrophication. To reduce the extent and severity of these problems, target nutrient loads were established and Total Maximum Daily Loads are being developed for many tributaries. Without detailed loading information it is difficult to determine if the targets are being met and how to prioritize rehabilitation efforts. To help address these issues, SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) models were developed for estimating loads and sources of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) from the United States (U.S.) portion of the Great Lakes, Upper Mississippi, Ohio, and Red River Basins. Results indicated that recent U.S. loadings to Lakes Michigan and Ontario are similar to those in the 1980s, whereas loadings to Lakes Superior, Huron, and Erie decreased. Highest loads were from tributaries with the largest watersheds, whereas highest yields were from areas with intense agriculture and large point sources of nutrients. Tributaries were ranked based on their relative loads and yields to each lake. Input from agricultural areas was a significant source of nutrients, contributing ∼33-44\% of the P and ∼33-58\% of the N, except for areas around Superior with little agriculture. Point sources were also significant, contributing ∼14-44\% of the P and 13-34\% of the N. Watersheds around Lake Erie contributed nutrients at the highest rate (similar to intensively farmed areas in the Midwest) because they have the largest nutrient inputs and highest delivery ratio.},

Zooplankton may even take up mineral nutrients directly, and use these to counter the effects of algal nutrient limitation (mineral compensation). This study examined the life history of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus fed phosphorus-, and nitrogen-limited Scenedesmus obliquus (Chlorophyta), and investigated whether B. calyciflorus was capable of mineral compensation. 2. Both phosphorus- and nitrogen-limited algae gave similar life history responses: somatic growth and reproduction were reduced, whereas lifespan remained unaffected. 3. No evidence was found for mineral compensation in B. calyciflorus in relation to detrimental life history effects, so mineral compensation does not seem to be relevant for this species under field conditions. 4. The similarity in life history responses of B. calyciflorus and the low levels of ω-3 PUFAs in both phosphorus- and nitrogen-depleted algae suggest that ω-3 PUFAs were limiting to B. calyciflorus, although other (bio)chemicals or mineral nutrients may also have been important. 5. No trade-off was observed between life span and reproduction during algal nutrient limitation. Reduced population growth rates of B. calyciflorus were caused by shorter reproductive periods.},

	abstract = {1. Herbivorous zooplankton maintain a rather constant elemental composition in their body mass as compared with the variability commonly encountered in their food. Furthermore, their high phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) content means that they often face an excess of carbon (C) in their diet. Regulation of this surplus of energy may occur via modulation of assimilation efficiency, or postassimilation by increased respiration (CO2) and/or excretion dissolved organic carbon, DOC. Whereas several studies have examined the effect of elemental imbalance in the genus Daphnia, few have examined other zooplankton taxa. 2. We investigated whether the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus uses increased respiration as a means of stoichiometrically regulating excess dietary C. Growth rate and respiration were measured under different food qualities (C : N and C : P ratios). 3. Both C : N and C : P ratios in food had strong effects on growth rate, demonstrating strong nutrient limitation of rotifer growth when nutrient elements were depleted in the diet and indicating the need for stoichiometric regulation of excess ingested C. 4. Respiration measurements, supported by a stoichiometric model, indicated that excess C was not released as CO2 in B. calyciflorus and that nutrient balance must therefore be maintained by other means such as excretion of DOC or egestion in faecal material.},

The goal of this study is to analyze the impacts of such features on the stationarity and dependence between monthly mean maximum and minimum water levels in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River from 1919 to 2012. As far as stationarity is concerned, the Lombard method brought out shifts in mean and variance values of monthly mean water levels in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River related to regulation of these waterbodies in the wake of the digging of the St. Lawrence Seaway in the mid-1950s. Water level shifts in the other lakes are linked to climate variability. As for the dependence between water levels, the copula method revealed a change in dependence mainly between Lakes Erie and Ontario following regulation of monthly mean maximum and minimum water levels in the latter. The impacts of manmade features primarily affected the temporal variability of monthly mean water levels in Lake Ontario.},

Historical Lake Ontario outflows could not be used for the study because of anthropogenic effects reflected in the data, the statistically short record length, and autocorrelation of the data. Stochastically generated Great Lakes net basin supplies were used in a Great Lakes hydrologic response model to obtain Lake Ontario levels and outflows. A significant problem was the lack of robustness in the Lake Superior and Lake Ontario regulation plans during simulations with extreme water supplies. The regulation plans were modified consistent with the International Joint Commission's regulation criteria and past operational actions to give reasonable results under these conditions. The simulated Lake Ontario levels and flows had a greater range than those resulting from historical water supplies. The maximum simulated Lake Ontario quarter-monthly level was 76.41 m (IGLD 55), and the maximum simulated quarter-monthly outflow was 14,160 m3s−1. The maximum-flow limitation of Lake Ontario's regulation plan, 8,780 m3s−1, was exceeded 0.27\% of the time. The upper lake-level regulation limit, 75.22 m, was exceeded 0.15\% of the time. It was found that some of the regulation criteria cannot be met simultaneously under extreme conditions. Historical water supplies, the current standard for the design and evaluation of modifications to the operational regulation plans, should no longer be the sole test of the plans.},

These preliminary results from the wetland show marked seasonal changes in dissolved concentration for all elements except Zn and Cu. Concentrations are found to be low until about mid-February and then increase abruptly. The onset of trace element release appears to coincide with a marked decline in redox potential and increase of organic carbon content. Because this decline is itself correlated with a pronounced increase in temperature and dissolved Fe, Mn and organic carbon content, we suggest that the microorganisms which use soil iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides as electron acceptors catalyzed the change in redox conditions and induced an increase of DOC. Temporal changes were also observed in the recipient stream which showed marked positive concentration peaks during stormflow events (except Zn). The seasonal processes occurring in the wetland appear to play a major role in determining the amount of trace elements which are transferred from the wetland to the river.},

 the original biodiversity of a community. The two models that address
 plant nutrient competition also predict that ecosystem nutrient
 retention increases with biodiversity and that the effects of
 biodiversity on productivity and nutrient retention increase with
 interspecific differences in resource requirements. All three models
 show that both species identity and biodiversity simultaneously
 influence ecosystem functioning, but their relative importance varies
 greatly among the models. This theory reinforces recent experimental
 results and shows that effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning

	abstract = {Wetlands provide many important ecosystem services to human society, which may depend on how plant diversity influences biomass production and nutrient retention. Vascular aquatic plant diversity may not necessarily enhance wetland ecosystem functioning, however, because competition among these plant species can be strong, often resulting in the local dominance of a single species. Here we have manipulated the species richness of rooted, submerged aquatic plant (macrophyte) communities in experimental wetland mesocosms. We found higher algal and total plant (algal plus macrophyte) biomass, as well as lower loss of total phosphorus, in mesocosms with a greater richness of macrophyte species. Greater plant biomass resulted from a sampling effect; that is, the increased chance in species mixtures that algal production would be facilitated by the presence of a less competitive species—in this case, crisped pondweed. Lower losses of total phosphorus resulted from the greater chance in species mixtures of a high algal biomass and the presence of sago pondweed, which physically filter particulate phosphorus from the water. These indirect and direct effects of macrophyte species richness on algal production, total plant biomass and phosphorus loss suggest that management practices that maintain macrophyte diversity may enhance the functioning and associated services of wetland ecosystems.},

Calibration and validation of the SWAT model were based on comparisons between the simulated and observed discharge with a monthly temporal resolution from 1961 to 2011 for the Kaqun hydrological station. The results reaffirmed the viability of the approach for simulating glacier runoff, as evidenced by a Nash–Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) of 0.82–0.86 as well as a percentage bias (PBIAS) of −4.5\% to 2.4\%, for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. Over the last 50 years, the total discharge and glacier runoff both exhibited increasing trends with 0.031 × 109 m3·a−1 and 0.011 × 109 m3·a−1. The annual glacier runoff contribution to the streamflow was between 42.3\% and 64.5\%, with an average of 51.6\%, although the glaciers accounted for only 12.6\% of the watershed drainage area in the mountainous YRB. The monthly contribution of the glacier runoff ranged from 11.0\% in April to 62.1\% in August, and the glacier runoff from June to September accounted for about 86.3\% of the annual glacier runoff. Runoff from the mountainous regions above 5000 m a.s.l. accounted for 70.5\% of the total discharge, with glacier runoff contributions being approximately 46.4\%.},

	doi = {10.1080/10256010600839707},
	abstract = {We present the results of an isotope (2H and 18O) and hydrogeochemical study in order to constrain the origin, recharge, and evolution of the surface and groundwater in the arid Andean realm of the Elqui watershed. The results of 2H and18O analyses of water samples obtained during our summer and winter campaigns indicate a generally meteoric origin of the river and spring waters of the watershed. The isotope signature of water of the Elqui river and its tributaries as well as that of groundwater in the coastal region fits the 2H-18O relation of delta2H =7.61delta18O+6.1. A relatively fast discharge and a quasi-closed catchment area can be asserted for water along the river flow path. The tributaries from the more arid coastal area, north of the Elqui river, differ in their isotopic signature due to evaporation and hydrochemically due to interactions with the strongly altered and fractured volcanic rocks of the basement. In the Andean zone, the18O-enriched hydrothermal spring of Baños del Toro exhibits the influence of water-rock interaction processes. The chemistry of the river water changes from sulphate- to chloride-rich along the river course from the high Andean mountains to the coast. The sulphate-rich character of these Andean waters reflects their passage through sulphide-rich rock massifs that were subjected to strong oxidation processes in the near superficial environment. This sulphate signature is enforced by past and present mining of precious metal epithermal deposits (e.g. those of El Indio-Tambo Au-Cu-As district), in which mineralised zones were developed during a series of Miocene magmatic-hydrothermal episodes in the Andean realm. Owing to the proximity of the lower Elqui river waters and its tributaries to the Pacific coast, the chloride character may be induced by agricultural and marine (sea spray, fog) sources. Generally, the main source of the Elqui river water is mainly attributed to surface runoff and less to contributions from the basement fractured aquifer.},

	abstract = {In 2011, Lake Erie experienced the largest harmful algal bloom in its recorded history, with a peak intensity over three times greater than any previously observed bloom. Here we show that long-term trends in agricultural practices are consistent with increasing phosphorus loading to the western basin of the lake, and that these trends, coupled with meteorological conditions in spring 2011, produced record-breaking nutrient loads. An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the system. We further find that all of these factors are consistent with expected future conditions. If a scientifically guided management plan to mitigate these impacts is not implemented, we can therefore expect this bloom to be a harbinger of future blooms in Lake Erie.},

	abstract = {The direct competitive effects of exotic plants on natives are among the leading causes of plant extinctions worldwide. Allelopathy, one type of direct plant competition, has received relatively little research, particularly in aquatic and wetland systems, even though allelopathy can be a potent mechanism through which plant communities are structured. Typha angustifolia (narrow-leaved cattail) is an invasive exotic plant in North America that often forms monocultures in disturbed wetlands and is more invasive than native members of its genus. We tested whether T. angustifolia was allelopathic and whether it produced different biochemicals than a native congener by growing it with the native bulrush Bolboschoenus fluviatilis (river bulrush) in soil with and without activated carbon and by qualitatively and quantitatively comparing soluble phenolics produced in the roots of T. angustifolia and the native Typha latifolia (broad-leaved cattail). T. angustifolia had a strong allelopathic effect on B. fluviatilis, reducing the longest leaf length and root, shoot, and total biomass of B. fluviatilis. When the allelopathy of T. angustifolia was ameliorated by activated carbon, however, longest leaf length, ramet number, root biomass, shoot biomass, and total biomass of T. angustifolia were greatly reduced due to resource competition with B. fluviatilis. Furthermore, T. angustifolia produced different, but not more, soluble phenolics than T. latifolia suggesting that the identity of the phenolics is different between the two species rather than the concentrations. The allelopathic effects of T. angustifolia on a North American native wetland plant and its production of root biochemicals that appear to differ from those produced by a native congener are consistent with the possibility that T. angustifolia may use a novel allelochemical in its invasion of North American wetlands.},

	abstract = {Wetland biogeochemical transformations are affected by flow and mixing in wetland surface water. We investigate the influence of wind on wetland water flow by simultaneously measuring wind and surface water velocities in an enclosed freshwater wetland during 1 day of strong-wind conditions. Water velocities are measured using a Volumetric Particle Imager while wind velocities are measured via sonic-anemometer. Our measurements indicate that the wind interacting with the vegetation canopy generates coherent billows and that these billows are the dominant source of momentum into the wetland water column. Spectral analysis of velocity time series shows that the spectral peak in water velocity is aligned with the spectral peak of in-canopy wind velocity, and that this peak corresponds with the Kelvin-Helmholtz billow frequency predicted by mixing layer theory. We also observe a strong correlation in the temporal pattern of velocity variance in the air and water, with high variance events having similar timing and duration both above and below the air-water interface. Water-side variance appears coupled with air-side variance at least down to 5 cm, while the theoretical Stokes' solution predicts momentum transfer down to only 2 mm assuming transfer via molecular viscosity alone. This suggests that the wind-driven flow contributed to significant mixing in the wetland water column.},

Regional precipitation is identified as the primary driver of lake levels with sub-monthly time lag, implying that the lake-level time series can be used as a proxy for regional precipitation throughout most of the 1865–present instrumental record. Aside from secular variations associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, the lake-level time series is dominated by two near-decadal cycles with periods of 8 and 12 years. A combination of correlation analysis and compositing suggests that the 8-y cycle stems from changes in daily wintertime precipitation amounts associated with individual storms, possibly due to large-scale atmospheric flow anomalies that affect moisture availability. In contrast, the 12-y cycle is caused by changes in the number of instances, or frequency, of summertime convective precipitation due to a preferred upper-air trough pattern situated over the Great Lakes. In recent decades, the lake-level budget exhibited an abnormal—relative to the remainder of the instrumental record—evaporation-driven trend, likely connected to regional signatures of anthropogenic climate change. The latter effect must be accounted for, along with the effects of precipitation, when assessing possible scenarios of future lake-level variability.},

	abstract = {The influence of water level fluctuation on sediment–water nutrient exchange in coastal wetlands of Lakes Michigan and Huron was investigated using controlled, laboratory experiments. At each wetland, sediment cores were collected from 5 locations along a transect perpendicular to the shoreline, desiccated for 8 weeks, and then re-wetted with original site water for 24 h to simulate water level fluctuation. Soluble reactive phosphorus release declined exponentially along transects, with highest release rates from sediments collected at the ordinary high water mark (OHWM), and lowest rates from sediments underlying water \&gt; 0.25 m in depth. Nitrate exchange showed no obvious pattern in the Lake Michigan wetlands but nitrate was lost at all locations in the Lake Huron wetlands, suggesting denitrification. Ammonium was released at all sites, but with no obvious pattern along transects. Sulfate release was low at the OHWM locations and increased in a lakeward direction, plateauing by the 0.25 m water depth.

Based on phosphorus (P) release rates, we modeled water level scenarios based on climate change projections to estimate the effects of 3 different water level recessions and 1 water level increase on system-level P exchange. The impact of the P release could be ecologically significant in the localized area of release given the high P concentrations measured in the overlying water during sediment incubations (\&gt; 500 μg/L). The long-term ecological significance of sediment nutrient flux under fluctuating water levels deserves further attention.},

An empirical relationship is established between the somatic juvenile growth rate (g) and the instantaneous rate of increase (r) in Daphnia magna in order to test if g can be used as a measure of fitness. Tested variables influencing g include food concentration, temperature, clonal differences and maternal effects. 2. The juvenile growth rate g was calculated for fixed time periods of 2 to 6 days (g$_{\textrm{f}}$) or for the `physiological' juvenile period to the deposition of the first clutch (g$_{\textrm{j}}$), which varied with environmental conditions. Both g$_{\textrm{f}}$ and g$_{\textrm{j}}$ resulted in linear relationships between g and r when food concentration was the only variable. If the other variables were included then only g$_{\textrm{j}}$ resulted in a good fit. 3. Although the relationship may be slightly curvilinear, g$_{\textrm{j}}$ is a robust predictor of r. The ratio r:g$_{\textrm{j}}$ is not affected by juvenile size and size at maturation. Hence g$_{\textrm{j}}$, can be used as a relative measure of fitness in Daphnia. This can save considerable time and effort when determining reaction norms in life-table experiments with many genotypes.},

We developed a wetland zooplankton index (WZI) based oil water quality and zooplankton associations with aquatic vegetation (emergent, submergent, and floating-leaf) that could be used to assess wetland quality, in particular in marshes of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. Seventy coastal and inland marshes were sampled during 1995-2000 these ranged from pristine, macrophyte-dominated systems, to highly degraded systems containing only a fringe of emergent vegetation. The index was developed based on the results of a partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA), which indicated that plant-associated taxa such as chydorid and macrothricid eladocerans were common in high-quality wetlands while more open-water, pollution-tolerant taxa (e.g., Brachionus, Moina) dominated degraded wetlands. The WZI was found to be more useful than indices of diversity H', species richness) and measures of community structure (mean cladoceran Size, total abundance) for indicating wetland quality. Furthermore, an independent test of the WZI in a coastal wetland of the Great Lakes, Cootes Paradise Marsh, correctly detected moderate improvements in water quality following carp exclusion. Since wetlands used in this study covered a wide environmental and geographic range, the index should be broadly applicable to wetlands in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, while further research is required to confirm its suitability in other regions and other vegetated habitats.},

	abstract = {While Great Lakes' seasonal water-level variations have been previously researched and well documented, few studies thus far addressed longer-term, decadal cycles contained in the 143-yr lake-level instrumental record. Paleo-reconstructions based on Lake Michigan's coastal features, however, hinted to an approximate 30-yr quasi-periodic lake-level variability. in the present study, spectral analysis of 1865-2007 Lakes Michigan/Huron historic levels revealed 8 and 12-yr period oscillations; these time scales match those of large-scale climatic signals previously found in the North Atlantic. While the existing paleodata are inadequate to the task of asserting significance of the 30-yr signal, it is suggested here that this cycle is due to intermodulation of the two near-decadal signals. Furthermore, water budget analysis argues that the North Atlantic decadal climate modes translate to the lake levels primarily through precipitation and its associated runoff. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Interest by land-management and regulatory agencies in using biological indicators to detect wetland degradation, coupled with ongoing use of this approach to assess water quality in streams, led to the desire to develop and evaluate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for wetlands that could be used to categorize the level of degradation. We undertook this challenge with data from coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes, which have been degraded by a variety of human disturbances. We studied six barrier beach wetlands in western Lake Superior, six drowned-river-mouth wetlands along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, and six open shoreline wetlands in Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron. Plant, fish, and invertebrate communities were sampled in each wetland. The resulting data were assessed in various forms against gradients of human disturbance to identify potential metrics that could be used in IBI development. Our results suggested that the metrics proposed as potential components of an IBI for barrier beach wetlands of Lake Superior held promise. The metrics for Lake Michigan drowned-river-mouth wetlands were inconsistent in identifying gradients of disturbance; those for Lake Huron open embayment wetlands were yet more inconsistent. Despite the potential displayed by the Lake Superior results within the year sampled, we concluded that an IBI for use in Great Lakes wetlands would not be valid unless separate scoring ranges were derived for each of several sequences of water-level histories. Variability in lake levels from year to year can produce variability in data and affect the reproducibility of data collected, primarily due to extreme changes in plant communities and the faunal habitat they provide. Substantially different results could be obtained in the same wetland in different years as a result of the response to lake-level change, with no change in the level of human disturbance. Additional problems included limited numbers of comparable sites, potential lack of undisturbed reference sites, and variable effects of different disturbance types. We also evaluated our conclusions with respect to hydrologic variability and other major natural disturbances affecting wetlands in other regions. We concluded that after segregation of wetland types by geographic, geomorphic, and hydrologic features, a functional IBI may be possible for wetlands with relatively stable hydrology. However, an IBI for wetlands with unpredictable yet recurring influences of climate-induced, long-term high water periods, droughts, or drought-related fires or weather-related catastrophic floods or high winds (hurricanes) would also require differing scales of measurement for years that differ in the length of time since the last major natural disturbance. A site-specific, detailed ecological analysis of biological indicators may indeed be of value in determining the quality or status of wetlands, but we recommend that IBI scores not be used unless the scoring ranges are calibrated for the specific hydrologic history pre-dating any sampling year.},

	abstract = {Previously described models for predicting the percent of Lake Ontario wetlands that would be occupied by sedge/grass-dominated meadow marsh were used to test four proposed new plans for regulation of lake levels and to make comparisons with the current plan and unregulated conditions. The models for drowned river mouth, barrier beach, open embayment, and protected embayment wetlands assessed responses to lake levels that would be generated by each plan under net total supplies modified from those that occurred from1900 to 2000. In years when reduced supplies would allow meadow marsh regeneration, simulated unregulated lake levels produced the most meadow marsh in all wetland geomorphic types; current Plan 1958DD produced the least. Overall predicted percent meadow marsh under the test plans decreased in the order B+, 2007, D+, and A+, and the latter three plans produced rather similar results in many cases. Lower percentages of meadow marsh under some plans were due to insufficient low lake levels that could allow soils to dry and restrict invasion by cattails, as well as lack of periodic high lake levels that could kill invading upland plants. An assessment of seasonal lake-level characteristics demonstrated that Plan 2007 would reduce mean winter lake levels by 13 cm or more than Plan B+ and springtime lake levels by more than 10 cm. These seasonal differences could result in less winter habitat for muskrats and reduced access to spring spawning habitats for fish such as northern pike. Our model results provide important information for use in the process of selecting a new regulation plan for Lake Ontario.},

The present paper outlines the general approach, scientific methodology and applied management considerations of studies quantifying the relationships between hydrology and wetland plant assemblages (\% occurrence, surface area) in Lake Ontario and the Upper and Lower St. Lawrence River. Although similar study designs were used across the study region, different methodologies were required that were specifically adapted to suit the important regional differences between the lake and river systems, range in water-level variations, and confounding factors (geomorphic types, exposure, sediment characteristics, downstream gradient of water quality, origin of water masses in the Lower River). Performance indicators (metrics), such as total area of wetland in meadow marsh vegetation type, that link wetland response to water levels will be used to assess the effects of different regulation plans under current and future (climate change) water-supply scenarios.},

Sensitivity to flow regime alteration via hydrologic regulation, however, may limit their populations and ability to facilitate wetland diversity and heterogeneity. Muskrat house surveys in coastal wetlands in tributaries (reference wetlands) subject to regional scale water level regulation were compared to treatment sites where local scale water-control structures were installed to alter the regulation effect. Data were used to develop a two-step model to predict wetland occupancy then house density to assess effects associated with proposed water level regulation plans. Field surveys indicated low house densities for cattail-dominated reference wetlands, and nearly 85\% of houses located were in treatment sites. House distribution at reference sites was limited to channel edges, whereas houses at treatment sites were found throughout the floodplain. Occupancy of wetlands by muskrats was estimated by winter water depth, and fall water depth, and winter air temperature were selected as predictors of house density. Model validation indicated complete agreement for wetland occupancy, but density tended to be underestimated. Simulations provided a tool to evaluate water management plans and indicated that muskrat populations are suppressed under the current water level regulation regime.},

However, limited understanding of habitat–fish assemblage relations hinders informed management and restoration of these communities. To help fill this information gap, we (1) described fish assemblages at 25 sites in Buffalo Harbor (Lake Erie), the upper Niagara River, and the St. Lawrence River, (2) compared assemblages among sites and waters, and (3) determined if assemblage structure was related to habitat variation. The structure of fish assemblages at muskellunge nursery sites was influenced by suitability of habitats for particular reproductive strategies and providing refugia from predation. Sites that had flowing water, coarse substrates, high macrophyte column density, and little or no macroalgae supported greater fish densities and more species-rich assemblages that were dominated by small-bodied, fusiform cyprinids. These complex habitats provided refugia from predation and were suitable for open substratum spawners. Shallow sites with negligible stream flow, fine substrates, low macrophyte column density, and greater macroalgae coverage contained small-bodied, fusiform fishes; deeper sites with similar habitat were dominated by larger-bodied, laterally-compressed centrarchids and yellow perch (Perca flavescens), whose reproductive strategies and anti-predator adaptations allow them to persist in such habitats. Small-bodied, fusiform fishes such as banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus), cyprinids, and darters are important prey for young-of-the-year muskellunge, whereas laterally-compressed centrarchids and yellow perch are typically avoided. Managing for habitats that support abundant fusiform fishes should provide better nursery conditions and promote stronger year-class formation for muskellunge.},

	abstract = {Australian floodplain wetlands are sites of high biodiversity that depend on flows from rivers. Dams, diversions and river management have reduced flooding to these wetlands, altering their ecology, and causing the death or poor health of aquatic biota. Four floodplain wetlands (Barmah-Millewa Forest and Moira Marshes, Chowilla floodplain, Macquarie Marshes, Gwydir wetlands) illustrate these effects with successional changes in aquatic vegetation, reduced vegetation health, declining numbers of water-birds and nesting, and declining native fish and invertebrate populations. These effects are likely to be widespread as Australia has at least 446 large dams ({\textgreater}10 m crest height) storing 8.8 × 107 ML (106 L) of water, much of which is diverted upstream of floodplain wetlands. More than 50\% of floodplain wetlands on developed rivers may no longer flood. Of all of the river basins in Australia, the Murray-Darling Basin is most affected with dams which can store 103\% of annual runoff and 87\% of divertible water extracted (1983–84 data). Some floodplain wetlands are now permanent storages. This has changed their biota from one tolerant of a variable flooding regime, to one that withstands permanent flooding. Plans exist to build dams to divert water from many rivers, mainly for irrigation. These plans seldom adequately model subsequent ecological and hydrological impacts to floodplain wetlands. To avoid further loss of wetlands, an improved understanding of the interaction between river flows and floodplain ecology, and investigations into ecological impacts of management practices, is essential.},

	abstract = {Riparian wetlands are under heavy pressure from hydrological changes produced by dam construction and water diversion projects. There has been ample documentation of the relationship between the extent of flooding and the composition of shoreline plant communities, yet we have few models that allow us to predict the impact of altered flooding regimes on riparian wetlands. In the humid temperate zone, river regulation commonly affects the distribution of two major vegetation types: wooded wetland and herbaceous wetland. The practice of reducing peak floods and augmenting minimum river flows is often followed by the succession of herbaceous to wooded wetland. We used logistic regression models to describe the distribution of wooded wetland as a function of all possible combinations of seven hydrological variables. The variables were chosen to reflect the depth, duration, and time of flooding and were calculated for four different time intervals (3, 7, 12, and 18 growing seasons). Our best model was a combination of two variables: the last day of the first flood and the time of the second flood. For three of the four time intervals, the vegetation type was correctly identified as herbaceous or wooded for {\textgreater}80\% of the sample points. Our results suggest that models based on a few key environmental variables can be valuable tools in the conservation management of the vegetation of temperate and boreal zone wetlands.},

	abstract = {Through an analysis of at-a-station channel and reach-averaged fluvial properties, we document the stream channel, riparian, and hydraulic adjustments associated with six dams in the Upper Connecticut River basin. For the reach-scale geomorphic analysis, we measured channel planform properties of five tributaries and one mainstem section using geographic information systems of available aerial photographs that pre- and postdate the dams. For the at-a-station morphological adjustments, we used field-measured U.S. Geological Survey stream gauge data of channel hydraulic geometry and discharge. Width, mean depth, cross-sectional area, mean velocity, roughness, and bed elevation were assessed for changes subsequent to dam closure while the reach-scale metrics, sinuosity, and wetted perimeter width, were measured by aerial photography. Corresponding to relatively minor changes in the frequency and magnitude of channel-maintaining flows, we observed no significant differences between pre- and postdam channel morphology in the mainstem section. In the tributaries, where major hydrologic alteration has occurred, we observed some statistically significant adjustment at both cross-section and reach scales. These effects, however, have been relatively minor, and are not consistent across dams in the magnitude, direction, or type of change observed. In highly forested upland New England watersheds, characterized by modest sediment loads, stable channels, and relatively low storage/runoff ratios, channel changes in response to hydrologic alteration appear to be small and contingent on local conditions and landscape history. These responses are in strong contrast to impacts in other geographical regions, and underscore the importance of considering regional hydroclimatic context in large-scale assessments of the impacts of dams.},

The chlorophyll content of the cultures was lower during nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency. Results from natural populations of phytoplankton from eutrophic lakes and from a coastal marine station gave values mostly ranging from 1.5 to 3.7\% chlorophyll, corresponding to carbon/chlorophyll ratios of 27–67. If only a rough estimate of the phytoplankton carbon biomass is required, a simple, efficient extraction procedure can be used without any corrections for degradation products.},

	abstract = {The seasonal distributions of phytoplankton biovolume and chlorophyll a content were monitored for 14 months in a deep oligotrophic, high mountain lake (Redó, Pyrenees). An allometric relationship of chlorophyll with biovolume was found throughout the period studied, with a correlation coefficient of 0.66. However, the relationship changed with season and the taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton. Both parameters showed a similar seasonal pattern, but differences in space and time were observed. The chlorophyll maximum was recorded deeper and later than that of phytoplankton biovolume. While the biovolume maximum was related to an improvement in conditions for growth (nutrient input during column mixing periods), and reflected an increase in biomass, the chlorophyll maximum was related to changes in cell pigment content, and to spatial or successional trends in species dominance. Flagellated chrysophytes predominated at the chlorophyll maxima. Chlorophyll content per unit of phytoplankton biovolume fluctuated greatly throughout the year, depending on light intensity, temperature and phytoplankton composition. Of the main groups of phytoplankton in the lake, the dinoflagellates, which dominated the summer epilimnion phytoplankton community, recorded the lowest pigment content per biovolume (which is consistent with their size). Higher chlorophyll contents per biovolume were found in the deep hypolimnion and during the winter cover period associated with small cells such as some species of chlorococcales chlorophytes. When flagellated chrysophytes were predominant, a broad range of chlorophyll values per biovolume was found and there was no significant correlation between the two biomass indices. These findings reaffirm the need to treat phytoplankton biomass estimates with caution, in particular when conducting primary production studies. While our results show that changes in chlorophyll content per cell occur as a photoacclimation response along a vertical profile, they also point out a component of the successional trends which appear in a phytoplankton growth phase in a lake.},

	abstract = {Direct approaches for estimating the feeding rate of the opossum shrimp Mysis relicta can be hampered by variable gut residence time (evacuation rate models) and non-linear functional responses (clearance rate models). Bioenergetics modeling provides an alternative method, but the reliability of this approach needs to be evaluated using independent measures of growth and food consumption. In this study, we measured growth and food consumption for M. relicta and compared experimental results with those predicted from a Mysis bioenergetics model. For Mysis reared at 10°C, model predictions were not significantly different from observed values. Moreover, decomposition of mean square error indicated that 70\% of the variation between model predictions and observed values was attributable to random error. On average, model predictions were within 12\% of observed values. A sensitivity analysis revealed that Mysis respiration and prey energy density were the most sensitive parameters affecting model output. By accounting for uncertainty (95\% CLs) in Mysis respiration, we observed a significant improvement in the accuracy of model output (within 5\% of observed values), illustrating the importance of sensitive input parameters for model performance. These findings help corroborate the Mysis bioenergetics model and demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for estimating Mysis feeding rate.},

For the Laurentian Great Lakes, where, since the early 1970s, nutrient inputs have been reduced, whereas top-predator biomass has increased, we describe trends across multiple trophic levels and explore their underlying drivers. Our analyses revealed increasing water clarity and declines in phytoplankton, native invertebrates, and prey fish since 1998 in at least three of the five lakes. Evidence for bottom-up regulation was strongest in Lake Huron, although each lake provided support in at least one pair of trophic levels. Evidence for top-down regulation was rare. Although nonindigenous dreissenid mussels probably have large impacts on nutrient cycling and phytoplankton, their effects on higher trophic levels remain uncertain. We highlight gaps for which monitoring and knowledge should improve the understanding of food-web dynamics and facilitate the implementation of ecosystem-based management.},

Research has recently shifted from a focus on factors influencing migration to how migration affects nutrient cycling and habitat coupling. Here we evaluate the potential for Daphnia migrations to incorporate metalimnetic productivity in a well-studied northern Wisconsin lake. We use prior studies conducted between 1985 and 1990 and current diel migration data (2008) to compare day and night Daphnia vertical distributions with the depth of the metalimnion (between the thermocline and 1\% light depth). Daphnia migrate from a daytime mean residence depth of between about 1.7 and 2.5 m to a nighttime mean residence depth of between 0 and 2.0 m. These migrations are consistent between the prior period and current measurements. Daytime residence depths of Daphnia are rarely deep enough to reach the metalimnion; hence, metalimnetic primary production is unlikely to be an important resource for Daphnia in this system.},

	abstract = {Lake-wide zooplankton surveys are critical for documenting and understanding food web responses to ecosystem change. Surveys in 2003 and 2008 during the binational intensive field year in Lake Ontario found that offshore epilimnetic crustacean zooplankton declined by a factor of 12 (density) and factor of 5 (biomass) in the summer with smaller declines in the fall. These declines coincided with an increase in abundance of Bythotrephes and are likely the result of direct predation by, or behavioral responses to this invasive invertebrate predator. Whole water column zooplankton density also declined from 2003 to 2008 in the summer and fall (factor of 4), but biomass only declined in the fall (factor of 2). The decline in biomass was less than the decline in density because the average size of individual zooplankton increased. This was due to changes in the zooplankton community composition from a cyclopoid/bosminid dominated community in 2003 to a calanoid dominated community in 2008. The increase in calanoid copepods was primarily due to the larger species Limnocalanus macrurus and Leptodiaptomus sicilis. These cold water species were found in and below the thermocline associated with a deep chlorophyll layer. In 2008, most of the zooplankton biomass resided in or below the thermocline during the day. Increased importance of copepods in deeper, colder water may favor Cisco and Rainbow Smelt over Alewife because these species are better adapted to cold temperatures than Alewife.},

More specifically, the westward range expansion of quagga mussel into western Lake Erie and toward Lake Huron was investigated and the shell size, density, and biomass of zebra and quagga mussel with depth in southern Lake Ontario in 1992 and 1995 were compared. In Lake Erie, quagga mussel dominated the dreissenid community in the eastern basin and zebra mussel dominated in the western basin. In southern Lake Ontario, an east to west gradient was observed with the quagga mussel dominant at western sites and zebra mussel dominant at eastern locations. Mean shell size of quagga mussel was generally larger than that of zebra mussel except in western Lake Erie and one site in eastern Lake Erie. Although mean shell size and our index of numbers and biomass of both dreissenid species increased sharply in southern Lake Ontario between 1992 and 1995, the increase in density and biomass was much greater for quagga mussels over the 3-year period. In 1995, zebra mussels were most abundant at 15 to 25 m whereas the highest numbers and biomass of quagga mussel were at 35 to 45 m. The quagga mussel is now the most abundant dreissenid in areas of southern Lake Ontario where the zebra mussel was once the most abundant dreisenid; this trend parallels that observed for dreissenid populations in the Dneiper River basin in the Ukraine.},

Zooplankton segregate into gelatinous and non-gelatinous forms, with few intermediate taxa (chaetognaths, polychaetes, and pteropods). In most groups body composition is size independent. Exceptions are protozoans, chaetognaths, and pteropods, where larger individuals become increasingly watery. I speculate about the dichotomy in body composition and argue that differences in feeding mechanisms and predator avoidance strategies favor either a watery or a condensed body form, and that in the intermediate taxa the moderately elevated water content is related to buoyancy control and ambush feeding.},

	abstract = {Enrichment experiments with P and N were conducted in humic Lake Örträsket in northern Sweden. The composition of the microplankton community showed a dominance by bacterioplankton, followed by mixotrophic and potentially mixotrophic phytoplankton, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and autotrophic phytoplankton. Bacterioplankton was P limited for most of the ice-free period, and phytoplankton biomass and primary production mostly increased after enrichment with N, but not with P. The dominant group of phytoplankton, the mixotrophic flagellates, was stimulated by N but not by P, while obligate autotrophic species were stimulated only by P+N. It is suggested that N limitation in mixotrophic species is induced by grazing of P-rich bacteria. The results suggest that primary productivity in humic lakes can be limited by N and indicate the importance of phagocytosis as a means of nutrition in phytoplankton. A link is suggested to exist in humic lakes whereby heterotrophic bacterioplankton, which use humic compounds as their principal energy source, can transfer energy and nutrients to potentially autotrophic organisms, with subsequent utilization by other components of the food web.},

In addition, cytoplasm volumes were measured in 6 other algal species. Estimates of carbon content were then made by converting measured cytoplasm volumes to carbon biomass. From these measurements and conversions, the average percent carbon by dry weight was found to be 19\% (range 10–30\%) for diatoms and 35\% (range 29–43\%) for the nondiatom species. These values are lower than those previously reported. This is probably due to two facts: our estimates do not include extracellular carbon that may be associated with the cells, and vacuole relative volume (\% of total cell volume) ranged from 22 to 70\% in diatoms and 2 to 29\% for nondiatoms. The carbon content of cells with lower vacuole volumes more closely approximate those previously reported. Our estimations of percent silica by dry weight of diatoms averaged 60\% (range 40–78\%). Our values for silica content are closer to those reported for naturally occurring populations than to those for cultured populations.},

The results are discussed in terms of the environmental factors, e.g. food availability, predation, controlling biomass production of particle- feeders and predators in the pelagic system of lakes. The marked seasonality in the length-standardized carbon content of Daphnia, and its time-specific trend suggest that from spring onward food availability for Daphnia population may be regarded as a simple decay function. Seasonality does not affect the carbon content/unit length of the two predator Cladocera Leptodora kindtii and Bythotrephes longimanus. Predation is probably the most important regulating factor for the seasonal dynamics of their carbon biomass. The existence of a constant factor to convert the diameter of Conochilus colonies into carbon seems reasonable for an organism whose population comes on quickly and just as quickly disappears.},

	abstract = {Benthic and pelagic secondary production were measured at nearshore and offshore sites in the western, west-central, and eastern basins of Lake Erie in 1993 to determine the relative importance of benthic and pelagic foodwebs to the fish community after dreissenid colonization. Benthic biomass increased greatly between 1979 and 1993 because of the presence of dreissenids, and{\textgreater}90\% of benthic production in 1993 came from dreissenids. Biomass of “other” benthos (excluding unionids and dreissenids) did not decline. Dreissenid production was in addition to, and not at the expense of, “other” benthic production. Zooplankton production was close to or within the 95\% confidence interval of that predicted from primary production (photosynthesis) based on the relationship described by Makarewicz and Likens (1979). Deviations from this relationship were correlated with summer zooplankton mean length, suggesting that planktivory was an important factor in the regulation of zooplankton production in the lake. Dreissenids therefore impact zooplankton production by reducing algal biomass and primary production particularly in unstratified regions, by decreasing rotifer abundance and hence biomass and production, and by producing veligers which contribute 10\% to 25\% to zooplankton production. Potential fish biomass which could be supported by the benthic and pelagic foodwebs was estimated from empirical equations. The benthic food chain could potentially support more fish biomass than the pelagic food chain in all basins in 1993, even if dreissenids were excluded from the calculations.},

For this purpose, six HSF-CWs were used: two non-cultivated (HSF-CWs 1 and 4), two cultivated with Tifton 85 grass (Cynodon spp.) (HSF-CWs 2 and 5) and two cultivated with Alternanthera (Alternanthera philoxeroides) (HSF-CWs 3 and 6). It was made a reversal in the flow direction of the HSF-CWs 1, 2 and 3. The reversal of the wastewater flow direction was performed when the superficial flow of the wastewater applied (SF) reached 50\% of the length of the HSF-CWs. There was a single reversal for each system, on different dates. Reversing the flow direction promoted distinction on the dry matter yield of Tifton 85 grass. This was not observed in HSF-CWs cultivated with Alternanthera. The reversal of the wastewater flow direction promoted, in principle, the extinction of the SF advance in the HSF-CWs, but did not prevent its return. Waiting for the SF to reach 50\% of the length was not the best criterion for reversing the flow direction.},

	url = {http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20135014},
	abstract = {Water allocation in the Upper Klamath Basin has become difficult in recent years due to the increase in occurrence of drought coupled with continued high water demand. Upper Klamath Lake is a central component of water distribution, supplying water downstream to the Klamath River, supplying water for irrigation diversions, and providing habitat for various species within the lake and surrounding wetlands. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component of the hydrologic budget of the lake and wetlands, and yet estimates of ET have been elusive—quantified only as part of a lumped term including other substantial water-budget components. To improve understanding of ET losses from the lake and wetlands, measurements of ET were made from May 2008 through September 2010. The eddy-covariance method was used to monitor ET at two wetland sites continuously during this study period and the Bowen-ratio energy-balance method was used to monitor open-water lake evaporation at two sites during the warmer months of the 3 study years. Vegetation at one wetland site (the bulrush site) consists of a virtual monoculture of hardstem bulrush (formerly Scirpus acutus, now Schoenoplectus acutus), and at the other site (the mixed site) consists of a mix of about 70 percent bulrush, 15 percent cattail (Typha latifolia), and 15 percent wocus (Nuphar polysepalum). Measured ET at these two sites was very similar (means were ±2.5 percent) and mean wetland ET is computed as a 70 to 30 percent weighted average of the bulrush and mixed sites, respectively, based on community-type distribution estimated from satellite imagery. Biweekly means of wetland ET typically vary from maximum values of around 6 to 7 millimeters per day during midsummer, to minimum values of less than 1 mm/d during midwinter. This strong annual signal primarily reflects life-cycle changes in the wetland vegetation, and the annual variation of radiative input to the surface and resulting temperature. The perennial vegetation begins each growing season submerged, emerges from the dead litter mat around late May or early June, reaches a maximum height of about 2.2 meters (m) during summer, senesces in October, and subsequently lodges over, contributing to the dead litter mat from previous years. Hydroperiods last about 5 to 6 months, typically beginning in January or February and ending in July or August, and have a minor influence on the annual ET cycle. These hydroperiods result from lake levels that typically vary about 1.3 m, from around 0.6 to 0.9 m above the wetland surface, to around 0.4 to 0.7 m below the wetland surface. An estimate of 3-year annual wetland ET, made by substituting early- and late-season data measured during 2009 for the missing periods in early 2008 and late 2010, is 0.938 meter per year (m/yr).

On the basis of temperature conditions in selected lakes and specified feeding levels, simulations are presented to quantify the importance of year-to-year variation of temperature in determining growth. In heterothermal systems, temperature selection by percids can have a significant effect on growth. For walleye on fixed rations, annual growth can vary from zero to twofold increments due entirely to differences in summer temperatures. Variations i..., Nous formulons une équation simple de budget énergétique conduisant à un modèle bioénergétique conçu pour simuler la croissance des poissons. Nous estimons les paramètres du modèle à partir de la littérature et les appliquons à la perchaude (Perca flavescens) et au doré jaune (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum). Nous décrivons des simulations démontrant les résultats du modèle comme fonctions de la grosseur du corps, du niveau d'activité, du niveau de ration, de la qualité de la nourriture et de la température ambiante. Des analyses de sensibilité démontrent l'importance de la consommation alimentaire, de l'activité et de l'excrétion comme processus biologiques représentés dans les paramètres. En nous fondant sur les conditions thermiques dans des lacs choisis et à des niveaux d'alimentation spécifiques, nous présentons des simulations permettant de quantifier l'importance des variations d'année en année de la température dans la détermination de la croissance.

	abstract = {Inundation hydrology and associated processes control biogeochemical processing in floodplains. To better understand how hydrologic connectivity, residence time, and intrafloodplain mixing vary in floodplain wetlands, we examined how water quality of two contrasting areas in the floodplain of the Atchafalaya River—a flow-through and a backwater wetland—responded to an annual flood pulse. Large, synoptic sampling campaigns occurred in both wetlands during the rising limb, peak, and falling limb of the hydrograph. Using a combination of conservative and reactive tracers, we inferred three dominant processes that occurred over the course of the flood pulse: flushing (rising limb), advective transport (peak), and organic matter accumulation (falling limb). Biogeochemistry of the two wetlands was similar during the peak while the river overflowed into both. However, during the rising and falling limbs, flow in the backwater wetland experienced much greater residence time. This led to the accumulation of dissolved organic matter and dissolved phosphorus. There were also elevated ratios of dissolved organic carbon to nitrate in the backwater wetland, suggesting nitrogen removal was limited by nitrate transported into the floodplain there. Collectively, our results suggest inclusion of a temporal component into the perirheic concept more fully describes inundation hydrology and biogeochemistry in large river floodplain.},

Densities of Chironomidae and Oligochaeta did not change. The decline in D. bugensis was most evident for individuals with shell lengths in the 3 to 14 mm range. The mean (±SD, n) abundance of round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) at 10-m depth increased from 6.5 (± 1.9, 12)/m2 in 2001 to 14(±1.0, 15/m2 in 2002. Analyses of stomach contents in 2001 and 2003, and stable isotopes of carbon in prey and muscle tissue in 2002, indicated that the diet of round gobies in 2001 was predominately dreissenids, but that chironomids and amphipods became more important as the abundance of appropriately sized mussels declined. Round gobies collected in 2003 contained more individual prey, but less total mass of prey than did gobies collected in 2001. Our observations suggest that round gobies probably became food-limited in eastern Lake Erie by 2002.},

	abstract = {Summary
This paper outlines a seven-step planning process being implemented on two large river basin studies currently underway in North America. One study involves the management of lake levels and flows in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River on the border between Canada and the US. The International Joint Commission that oversees all water management issues between these two countries supports this study. The other involves the Greater Everglades region in south Florida in the US. In both studies multiple agencies and multiple stakeholders are involved in an attempt to find better ways of meeting multiple economic, environmental and ecological objectives. Both studies were motivated by the desire to find ways of improving the habitat of ecosystems within their basins and at the same time providing no less, or if possible greater, economic and social benefits that are derived from reliable water supplies, flows, levels, and flood protection. The seven-step planning process attempts to provide a very transparent and fully participatory approach toward reaching a common vision among all agencies and stakeholders as to how their hydrological system can be adaptively managed to better meet current and future objectives. This paper presents the seven steps and focuses on how all the values of various objectives are being defined and considered, together, in an attempt to define what water management policy works best and to an agreement on just what is ‘best’.},

	abstract = {Water scarcity and invasive vegetation threaten arid-region wetlands and wetland managers seek ways to enhance wetland ecosystem services with limited water, labor, and financial resources. While prior systems modeling efforts have focused on water management to improve flow-based ecosystem and habitat objectives, here we consider water allocation and invasive vegetation management that jointly target the concurrent hydrologic and vegetation habitat needs of priority wetland bird species. We formulate a composite weighted usable area for wetlands (WU) objective function that represents the wetland surface area that provides suitable water level and vegetation cover conditions for priority bird species. Maximizing the WU is subject to constraints such as water balance, hydraulic infrastructure capacity, invasive vegetation growth and control, and a limited financial budget to control vegetation. We apply the model at the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge on the Great Salt Lake, Utah, compare model-recommended management actions to past Refuge water and vegetation control activities, and find that managers can almost double the area of suitable habitat by more dynamically managing water levels and managing invasive vegetation in August at the beginning of the window for control operations. Scenario and sensitivity analyses show the importance to jointly consider hydrology and vegetation system components rather than only the hydrological component.

	abstract = {Round goby Neogobius melanostomus were examined from the Bass Islands area in the western basin of Lake Erie, U.S.A., to determine age and growth correlations. A total of 188 specimens were collected and examined during summer 2011 with 90 aged using scale analysis. Fish were grouped by sex, depth of habitat and habitat type (anthropogenically modified shallows, natural shallows and open lake deep water). Fish ranged from 17 to 117 mm total length (LT) and 0+ to 3+ years. Males dominated the population (1·94:1) and backcalculated age showed that both sexes grew exponentially, with male growth rate increasing faster than female. Males were significantly larger than females in LT and mass (both P {\textless} 0·001). The relative mass index (Wr) was low for the sampled population (mean ± s.d. = 32·00 ± 26·87 g), implying that the health of the Bass Island area population is very poor when compared with the species throughout its range. This could be due to a lack of food resources related to population size or that the fish is not optimally utilizing the available food resources. In contradiction to these findings, regression slope coefficient (b), calculated using Fulton's condition factor (K) (mean ± s.d. =1·50 ± 0·20), was very low for each habitat, implying a healthy population throughout. This seemingly opposite effect may be due to more individuals per unit area in shallow waters, which would cause increased competition for resources. Poor condition may indicate that the Lake Erie population has reached saturation or may reflect indirect fitness costs associated with increasing anoxic or hypoxic hypolimnion conditions.},

(2) There were only minor differences in the growth rates of fish at the five hard water sites, but these rates were higher than those for the same fish species in the softer Docken's Water. At all sites growth was most rapid in the spring and early summer and though growth continued throughout the year there was a considerable decrease in the rate during the winter months. (3) Annual bullhead production ranged from 6.2 to 43.1 g/m2 (fresh weight) in the hard-water streams and this represented from 43 to 83\% of total fish production. Bullhead production was greatest during the first few months of life and was correlated directly with the density of the 0 group population. (4) Trout production ranged from 2.6 to 12.9 g/m2/annum (fresh weight) at the hard water sites and contributed from 7 to 37\% to the total fish production at each site. There was a more even distribution of production among the age groups than in the bullhead, and trout production at each site was affected by the proportion of each age group present. (5) In the soft water stream trout contributed 87\% (12.1 g/m2) of annual fish production, with most of the remainder coming from the minnow population. Bullheads did not occur in this stream.},

Condition factor, somatic condition factor and hepatosomatic index (HSI) were calculated as indirect indices of energy status and the accuracy of these indirect measures as predictors of energy status was investigated. Results indicate that both condition factors were significant predictors of energy reserves (lipid, protein, glycogen and total energy), but that the proportion of variance accounted for was small. Both condition factors perform better as predictors of energy content per unit body weight. The HSI was a significant, but a weak predictor of total glycogen levels over the whole year. On a seasonal basis the relationship between HSI and energy reserves was highly variable. These indices are therefore poor predictors of energy reserves in male three-spined sticklebacks.},

Since their arrival, the round goby has been implicated in many ecological changes—most notably changes in the flow of energy from the benthic to the pelagic food web through their consumption of dreissenid mussels. However, methods for evaluating the density and size of round gobies across different substrates are lacking, preventing the true quantification of the effects of round gobies on invaded ecosystems. In our study, we evaluated catch efficiency of numerous passive and active sampling methods for capturing round gobies. We then applied the best techniques to estimate the distribution, density, and biomass of round gobies in western Lake Erie. Visual census (underwater video transects) proved the best technique for assessing round goby size and density across a wide range of substrates. A combination of angling and bottom trawling proved most effective for obtaining biological samples. We estimated 9.9 billion round gobies in western Lake Erie in 2002. Continued efforts to describe abundance and demographics of round gobies in invaded ecosystems will enable scientists and managers to fully understand the impacts of this invading species.},

	abstract = {.  Most foodweb research in lentic systems has focused on pelagic primary (phytoplankton) and secondary (zooplankton) production as the primary energy sources for higher trophic-level production. Recent research has demonstrated that secondary production of benthic primary consumers can affect pelagic fish production and foodweb structure in lakes. We used the instantaneous growth method to calculate secondary production of chironomids in Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin (USA), where previous research has shown that lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) rely heavily on the benthos (chironomids) as a food source. We also used literature-derived data and the instantaneous growth method to calculate annual production of lake sturgeon to test whether chironomid production is sufficient to support the current lake sturgeon population in Lake Winnebago. We collected benthic samples with an Ekman grab at 4 profundal sites during ice-free conditions on 11 dates from spring 2008 through spring 2009. We measured instantaneous growth rates for 7 chironomid length classes at 5 thermal regimes in the laboratory. Mean annual density of Chironomidae was 2714 individuals/m2, mean biomass was 2.75 g dry mass (DM)/m2, and mean annual production of Chironomidae was 7.59 g DM m−2 y−1. Estimated annual production of lake sturgeon was 0.02 g DM m−2 y−1 in 2007. We concluded that in 2008–2009 chironomid secondary production was sufficient to support the lake sturgeon population in Lake Winnebago. The annual production rates for chironomids in Lake Winnebago are higher than rates in many other lakes in North America, presumably because of the eutrophic condition of Lake Winnebago.},

	abstract = {We extended a bioenergetics model of growth for the average individual alewife Alosa pseudoharengus to the Lake Michigan population of this species in the mid-1970s. We used the model to estimate patterns of total consumption of zooplankton by alewives. About 10\% of total annual zooplankton consumption by Lake Michigan alewives could be attributed to larval fish feeding during the first 40 d of life. Young-of-year and larval fish together accounted for 50\% of total annual consumption by alewives. Typical adult (age-3 and older) fish accounted for only 21\% of total consumption. We evaluated the sensitivity of estimates of consumption by alewife larvae by using upper and lower bounds on metabolic rate and energy density of larvae. Total consumption estimates based on the low and high metabolic rates differed by a factor of 3. Consumption was relatively insensitive to energy density. Modeling a 29-d, normally distributed spawning period versus a single-day spawning period resulted in a 9\% increase in total consumption from first-feeding larvae to fall young of the year. Predation by the alewife population was strongly seasonal: 45\% of total annual consumption occurred in August and September, and 73\% occurred during July through October. The mean daily population consumption (for each month), expressed as a percent of crustacean zooplankton biomass, peaked in August and September at about 8\% of biomass per day. Similar estimates for the mid-1980s alewife population were greatest in August at 2.3\% of zooplankton biomass consumed per day. We estimated potential consumption by the peak 1966 alewife population (ifsevere mortality had not occurred that year) at 20\% of zooplankton biomass per day, which suggested that food limitation was one cause of the severe mortality that year.},

	abstract = {We developed an energetics model for the alewife Alosa pseudoharengus to evaluate consumption and conversion efficiency processes. We estimated alewife standard metabolism (R) as a function of wet body weight (W, g) and water temperature (T, °C): R (g˙g−1˙d−1) = 0.0073 W−0.215e0.0548T. We estimated maximum daily ration for 15-g, yearling alewives at 20°C to be as much as 37\% of their body weight in experiments of 24 h. Modeling simulations based on observed growth in Lake Michigan indicated that yearling alewives may attain close to 70\% of their estimated maximum consumption rate during September and October. Simulation results indicated wide seasonal variations in consumption rates; almost 50\% of the yearly consumption by an individual adult alewife (age ≥ II) occurs in September and October, suggesting abundant food and possibly relaxed competition during that season. In contrast, adult alewives lose weight during the summer when stratification of Lake Michigan would permit orientation to water temperatures optimal for growth, suggesting that serious food limitations during that period may heighten competitive interactions. Over an annual cycle, adults converted only 1.3–2.8\% of food consumed (wet weight) to body biomass; young of the year converted 5\%. Conversion of energy consumed to body energy was higher than biomass conversion, but still relatively low for older age-classes–2.3–5.2\% for adults and 12.7\% for young of the year. Total annual consumption and conversion efficiency estimates were relatively insensitive to assumptions about seasonal dynamics of body energy density (J˙g−1 wet weight) but within seasons when energy density was changing rapidly, an assumption of constant energy density yielded errors of −45\% to 104\% for those variables.},

	abstract = {Based on 6 yr of high-resolution temperature profiles taken monthly in the 300-m-deep Lake Geneva (Lac Léman), we examine the hypothesis that vertical mixing is the dominant mixing mechanism in the hypolimnion. Using the flux gradient method, we estimate vertical turbulent mixing coefficients Kz for periods of 1 month, the summer warming season, and over the multiannual continuous heating trend observed in the lake. The hypolimnion can be divided into two distinct layers: above 90 m and below 90 m. A correlation between Kz and the Brunt-Väisälä frequency N2 is found in the upper hypolimnion down to ∼90 m, indicating that wind-induced vertical mixing is dominant there. Once a thermocline has developed at a depth of ∼20 m the heat gain below 90 m becomes very small, and stratification there is stronger than in the bottom layers of shallow lakes. In the deep hypolimnion we observed large-scale temperature inversions and intrusions, suggesting that mixing is noncontinuous and cannot be adequately described by vertical mixing alone.},

	abstract = {During summer (May-October), a positive relationship was evident between lake water levels and chlorophyll a concentrations in littoral and littoral:pelagic interface regions of Lake Okeechobee. High water levels in synergy with the large size (1830 km2), shallow depth (Zx = 2.7 m), and unique bottom configuration of Lake Okeechobee appeared to facilitate greater horizontal mixing and circulation which resulted in higher phosphorus concentrations in a portion of the littoral zone. In shallow littoral regions where light penetration was sufficient, an empirical link between phosphorus and chlorophyll a was evident. East-to-west and north-to-south gradients of phosphorus extended from hard-bottom littoral regions to the open-water pelagic zone located over soft, phosphorus-laden flocculent muds, and these gradients were more pronounced at low lake levels. Phosphorus loading from tributaries only affected algal concentrations in a small portion of the lake. A higher water level regulation schedule was implemented in 1978 to augment water supplies and this increased lake levels when precipitation was sufficient. A slightly lower lake level regulation schedule might reduce the frequency of hypereutrophic algal blooms in nearshore and littoral areas.},

The model effectively captures observations of both vertical and temporal trends in dissolved oxygen, as well as temporal trends in chlorophyll-a, phosphorus, zooplankton biomass, and several key processes. The model was used to develop a relationship between external phosphorus load and hypolimnion oxygen conditions, and then to establish load–response envelopes that account for inter-annual variability in physical conditions driven by variation in meteorological drivers.

Evidence of strong feedback between tree community-type and the salinity of the unsaturated (vadose) zone of the soil suggests that a severe disturbance that significantly tilts the salinity in the vadose zone might cause a shift from one vegetation type to the other. In this study, a model based upon the feedback dynamics between vegetation and salinity of the vadose zone of the soil was used to take account of storm surge events to investigate the mechanisms that by which this large-scale disturbance could affect the spatial pattern of hardwood hammocks and mangroves. Model simulation results indicated that a heavy storm surge that completely saturated the vadose zone at 30 ppt for 1 day could lead to a regime shift in which there is domination by mangroves of areas previously dominated by hardwood hammocks. Lighter storm surges that saturated the vadose zone at less than 7 ppt did not cause vegetation shifts. Investigations of model sensitivity analysis indicated that the thickness of the vadose zone, coupled with precipitation, influenced the residence time of high salinity in the vadose zone and therefore determined the rate of mangrove domination. The model was developed for a southern Florida coastal ecosystem, but its applicability may be much broader.},

To quantify more fully ecosystem dynamics in southern Kaneohe Bay, the Kaneohe Bay \{ECOsystem\} Model (KECOM) was developed. This model is a nine-compartment nitrogen cycle biogeochemical box model of the pelagic and benthic systems of the southern bay. The baseline quasi-steady state of the model produces a comparable net denitrification flux to that obtained by Hoover [Hoover, D., 2002. Fluvial nitrogen and phosphorus in Hawaii: storm runoff, land use, and impacts on coastal waters. Ph.D. Dissertation. University of Hawaii at Manoa, Oceanography] for the present-day N budget of southern Kaneohe Bay. The model describing solely the N cycle captured the general trends of changes in water quality parameters in response to a particular storm perturbation as observed by Ringuet and Mackenzie [Ringuet, S., Mackenzie, F.T. Controls on nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics during normal flow and storm runoff conditions, southern Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Estuaries, in press]; however, it did not entirely reproduce the timing and magnitude of the biological blooms that occurred along with the bay's recovery. The results point to the possible emergence of P-limitation as a factor influencing the bay's recovery from a large storm perturbation, as suggested by observations [Ringuet, S., Mackenzie, F.T. Controls on nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics during normal flow and storm runoff conditions, southern Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Estuaries, in press]. The stability analysis of \{KECOM\} using a community matrix approach indicated that the instability of the benthic autotrophic biomass is caused by low grazing and/or high nutrient uptake rates due to high irradiance and potential growth rate. These two possible causes reinforce two competing hypotheses that were put forward from observational work to account for the causes of the currently observed spread of nuisance benthic macroalgae in Kaneohe Bay. Finally, the eigenanalysis of the community matrices of \{KECOM\} showed that the use of an unconventional, high power Michaelis–Menten function to describe biological assimilation and grazing kinetics was needed to stabilize the system, suggesting a future research direction involving quantification of the strength of assimilation and grazing feedbacks. In addition as anticipated, such a finding also indicates that the N cycle alone does not provide sufficient feedbacks within the Kaneohe Bay ecosystem, necessitating an ecosystem model describing all the feedbacks involving the coupled C, N and P cycles.},

	abstract = {A stage-based model was developed to predict the effects of storm intensity and frequency on populations of the branching coral Acropora palmata. The data used to parameterize the model were obtained from an A. palmata population in the northern Florida Reef Tract that experienced three storms in 27 months. Storm intensity is a significant factor influencing the survivorship of A. palmata populations. After a severe storm, A. palmata populations can be numerically dominated by fragments and crusts. The shift in biomass from units with high survivorship (i.e. colonies) to units with higher mortality probabilities (i.e. fragments and crusts) can affect the recovery and long-term survivorship of disturbed populations. However, the model suggests that A. palmata still can benefit from periodic storms. When sexual recruitment is limited or sporadic, storm fragmentation followed by fragment survivorship and growth may be the only mechanism available for A. palmata to propagate. Storm frequency can also affect the survivorship of A. palmata. When storms occur at 15-year intervals, a slow increase in the abundance of colonies can take place after 10 consecutive storms. When storm frequency increases to 5 years, the abundance of colonies can increase five-fold after 10 storms. However, as storm frequency increases further (one storm every 2 years) a steady decline in the abundance of A. palmata colonies can occur.},

In this study, we evaluated the runoff reduction effectiveness under various setting sizes of green infrastructures using a process-based stormwater runoff model. The model was validated with field data from a typical community in Beijing and proved to be accurate in estimating stormwater runoff under larger rain events. The pervious area percentage and soil hydraulic properties were key parameters influencing stormwater runoff. The four types of green infrastructures, including green area expanding, concave green space, storage pond and porous brick pavement were effective in reducing stormwater runoff, but single facility except the storage pond could not fully control runoff of 5-year recurrence storm. With integrated green infrastructures, runoff of 5-year recurrence storm could be 100\% reduced by expanding the pervious area percentage to over 50\%, or increase storage pond volume to over 1800 m3, whereas a maximum runoff reduction of 95\% could be achieved when the green land was reformed to concave with a depth of 4 cm, or 50\% of the impervious area was replaced with porous brick pavement with a storage capacity of 8 mm. The combination of green infrastructures with proper setting sizes is necessary for optimal control of stormwater runoff management.},

	abstract = {Abstract How complex does a model need to be to provide useful predictions is a matter of continuous debate across environmental sciences. In the species distributions modelling literature, studies have demonstrated that more complex models tend to provide better fits. However, studies have also shown that predictive performance does not always increase with complexity. Testing of species distributions models is challenging because independent data for testing are often lacking, but a more general problem is that model complexity has never been formally described in such studies. Here, we systematically examine predictive performance of models against data and models of varying complexity. We introduce the concept of computational complexity, widely used in theoretical computer sciences, to quantify model complexity. In addition, complexity of species distributional data is characterized by their geometrical properties. Tests involved analysis of models’ ability to predict virtual species distributions in the same region and the same time as used for training the models, and to project distributions in different times under climate change. Of the eight species distribution models analyzed five (Random Forest, boosted regression trees, generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, MaxEnt) showed similar performance despite differences in computational complexity. The ability of models to forecast distributions under climate change was also not affected by model complexity. In contrast, geometrical characteristics of the data were related to model performance in several ways: complex datasets were consistently more difficult to model, and the complexity of the data was affected by the choice of predictors and the type of data analyzed. Given our definition of complexity, our study contradicts the widely held view that the complexity of species distributions models has significant effects in their predictive ability while findings support for previous observations that the properties of species distributions data and their relationship with the environment are strong predictors of model success.},

	abstract = {Abstract Climate change and land use management practices are major drivers of biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. To understand and predict resulting changes in community structures, individual-based and spatially explicit population models are a useful tool but require detailed data sets for each species. More generic approaches are thus needed. Here we present a trait-based functional type approach to model savanna birds. The aim of our model is to explore the response of different bird functional types to modifications in habitat structure. The functional types are characterized by different traits, in particular body mass, which is related to life-history traits (reproduction and mortality) and spatial scales (home range area and dispersal ability), as well as the use of vegetation structures for foraging and nesting, which is related to habitat quality and suitability. We tested the performance of the functional types in artificial landscapes varying in shrub:grass ratio and clumping intensity of shrub patches. We found that an increase in shrub encroachment and a decrease in habitat quality caused by land use mismanagement and climate change endangered all simulated bird functional types. The strength of this effect was related to the preferred habitat. Furthermore, larger-bodied insectivores and omnivores were more prone to extinction due to shrub encroachment compared to small-bodied species. Insectivorous and omnivorous birds were more sensitive to clumping intensity of shrubs whereas herbivorous and carnivorous birds were most affected by a decreasing amount of grass cover. From an applied point of view, our findings emphasize that policies such as woody plant removal and a reduction in livestock stocking rates to prevent shrub encroachment should prioritize the enlargement of existing grassland patches. Overall, our results show that the combination of an individual-based modelling approach with carefully defined functional types can provide a powerful tool for exploring biodiversity responses to environmental changes. Furthermore, the increasing accumulation of worldwide data sets on species’ core and soft traits (surrogates to determine core traits indirectly) on one side and the refinement of conceptual frameworks for animal functional types on the other side will further improve functional type approaches which consider the sensitivities of multiple species to climate change, habitat loss, and fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Abstract How complex does a model need to be to provide useful predictions is a matter of continuous debate across environmental sciences. In the species distributions modelling literature, studies have demonstrated that more complex models tend to provide better fits. However, studies have also shown that predictive performance does not always increase with complexity. Testing of species distributions models is challenging because independent data for testing are often lacking, but a more general problem is that model complexity has never been formally described in such studies. Here, we systematically examine predictive performance of models against data and models of varying complexity. We introduce the concept of computational complexity, widely used in theoretical computer sciences, to quantify model complexity. In addition, complexity of species distributional data is characterized by their geometrical properties. Tests involved analysis of models’ ability to predict virtual species distributions in the same region and the same time as used for training the models, and to project distributions in different times under climate change. Of the eight species distribution models analyzed five (Random Forest, boosted regression trees, generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, MaxEnt) showed similar performance despite differences in computational complexity. The ability of models to forecast distributions under climate change was also not affected by model complexity. In contrast, geometrical characteristics of the data were related to model performance in several ways: complex datasets were consistently more difficult to model, and the complexity of the data was affected by the choice of predictors and the type of data analyzed. Given our definition of complexity, our study contradicts the widely held view that the complexity of species distributions models has significant effects in their predictive ability while findings support for previous observations that the properties of species distributions data and their relationship with the environment are strong predictors of model success.},

	abstract = {To investigate the effect of summer monsoon-derived inputs of particulate organic matter (POM) on patterns of stable isotopes in the food web in a reservoir, we traced dietary sources of carbon and nitrogen in pelagic zooplankton and herbivorous littoral zoobenthos following a monsoonal disturbance in Lake Paldang, a large regulated reservoir in Korea. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were analyzed in POM, zooplankton, sedimentary organic matter, zoobenthos, and piscivorous fishes in pre- and post-summer monsoon periods. Sharp depletion of 13C and enrichment of 15N of POM along with elevated POC/Chl a ratios occurred following the summer monsoon period, reflecting the rapid reduction of phytoplankton biomass and a pulsed supply of terrestrial organic detritus. Herbivorous zooplankton δ13C values, which were initially similar to POM δ13C values in the pre-summer monsoon period, decreased to nearly that of terrestrial organic matter, providing isotopic evidence of allochthonous contribution to zooplankton in the post-summer monsoon period. In contrast, herbivorous zoobenthos in the littoral area and higher fishes appeared to have a similar stable isotope composition between the pre- and post-summer monsoon period. Our findings indicate that although monsoon storms dramatically decrease phytoplankton biomass, the augmented allochthonous material after the summer monsoon offsets this effect temporarily by subsidizing pelagic zooplankton production. Allochthonous subsidies to herbivorous littoral zoobenthos and piscivorous fishes are relatively limited.},

	abstract = {In lentic systems, hydrology can be dramatically altered after storm events, potentially modifying the carbon budget. In particular, rapid increases in the surface water carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) have been observed following such events. Several processes may explain these shifts in lake CO2 dynamics, including vertical mixing, increases in metabolism, and increases in external loading. To evaluate the relative importance of these various processes, we reconstructed the whole-lake daily CO2 budget using concurrent estimates of lake metabolism and daily CO2 mass balance budgets in two lakes with distinct morphometries located in Québec, Canada. We found that storm events caused variable, but significant, changes in whole-lake CO2 mass. Such events influenced CO2 dynamics indirectly by inducing shifts in lake metabolism, and directly by importing CO2 by the inflowing storm waters. Storm intensity (in terms of total amount of precipitation) influences the balance between these two processes, but the final outcome depends on lake morphometry. Our results suggest that when storms are intense enough to drive lake water renewal rate beyond 1\% day−1, external CO2 loadings became the dominant process, overwhelming internal CO2 production. Lakes with slower hydrological turnover, however, are more susceptible to internal regulation and may simply re-allocate CO2 from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion following a storm event. Our results thus suggest that this tightening of the watershed-lake-atmosphere linkage by climatic events is strongly modulated by lake morphometry. These features should be considered when predicting the impact of future climate change on regional C budgets and emissions.},

	abstract = {The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America have horizontal scales of hundreds of kilometers and depth scales of hundreds of meters. In terms of coastal dynamics, they behave much like inland seas and exhibit physical processes characteristic of the coastal oceans. The lakes are dynamically similar to the coastal ocean in that their horizontal dimensions are larger than the vertical dimensions, and the principal source of mechanical energy is the wind. The major difference in dynamical processes is that the lakes are enclosed basins and are not connected to the deep ocean. This paper presents an overview of some of the significant aspects of physical processes in the coastal zones of the Great Lakes. The review is based on examples ranging from lake-wide experiments like the International Field Year on the Great Lakes (IFYGL) to several process-oriented coastal boundary layer experiments. The basic circulations in the nearshore zone and coastal boundary layer are summarized. The review concludes with suggestions for future work on the understanding of the physical processes that would have a bearing on lake management in the coastal zones of the Great Lakes.},

	abstract = {Ecological and evolutionary dynamics can occur on similar timescales. However, theoretical predictions of how rapid evolution can affect ecological dynamics are inconclusive and often depend on untested model assumptions. Here we report that rapid prey evolution in response to oscillating predator density affects predator–prey (rotifer–algal) cycles in laboratory microcosms. Our experiments tested explicit predictions from a model for our system that allows prey evolution. We verified the predicted existence of an evolutionary tradeoff between algal competitive ability and defence against consumption, and examined its effects on cycle dynamics by manipulating the evolutionary potential of the prey population. Single-clone algal cultures (lacking genetic variability) produced short cycle periods and typical quarter-period phase lags between prey and predator densities, whereas multi-clonal (genetically variable) algal cultures produced long cycles with prey and predator densities nearly out of phase, exactly as predicted. These results confirm that prey evolution can substantially alter predator–prey dynamics, and therefore that attempts to understand population oscillations in nature cannot neglect potential effects from ongoing rapid evolution.},

	abstract = {Currently, no method exists to core large volumes of inland freshwater wetland soils that maintains stratigraphic integrity, minimizes unnecessary disturbance, and cores up to a depth of 50 cm. Our objective was to create a large-volume soil coring device that could be applied with consistency to a variety of wetland substrates. The result is a hand-operated soil corer that resembles the aluminum irrigation pipe corer that DeLaune et al. (1978) used to core soft marshy substrates. Instead of aluminum pipe, we used regular steel stovepipe and a variety of tools for insertion. After the sample is extracted from the sediment, the handle can be quickly removed for ease of transportation and storage of a core. The stovepipe can be cut open to expose the soil sample so that it can easily be sectioned for incremental analysis. The corer was used to take 130 samples in 18 different sites, spanning many different wetland substrate types. Our method has many applications, including radiochronologic dating, seed bank analysis, bulk density measurement, and soil contaminants analysis.},

	abstract = {Microcrustaceans are abundant in many freshwater wetlands, including forested floodplain swamps, but little has been done to assess their secondary production and functional role in these systems. Since standard cohort approaches to estimating secondary production are impossible with continuously growing and reproducing microcrustaceans, it is necessary to obtain independent determinations of their growth and reproductive characteristics under environmental conditions encountered in their natural habitat throughout the year. The growth and reproduction of Ceriodaphnia dubia fed natural swamp seston were measured at 10, 15, 20, and 25°C—temperatures which span much of the annual temperature range in southeastern floodplain swamps. Somatic biomass growth rates were as high as 61\% d−1. Total growth rates (somatic tissue and egg mass) reached 95\% d−1. Both somatic growth rates and total growth rates could be described as functions of individual size and temperature. High egg production, particularly in the larger instars, resulted in individuals maintaining high total growth rates ({\textgreater}20\% d−1 at most temperatures) over the lifespan. Lifetime egg production accounted for {\textgreater}50\% of biomass produced by individuals at all temperatures and {\textgreater}80\% for temperatures ≥20°C. Somatic growth rates for C. dubia fed swamp seston were within the range of literature estimates for other species of Ceriodaphnia under various food conditions.},

	abstract = {We studied the effects of food limitation on the population dynamics of the freshwater cyclopoid copepod Diacyclops thomasi in Oneida Lake, New York. In the field population, maximum juvenile abundance coincided seasonally with high phytoflagellate concentration. During the clear-water phase (a seasonal period of low algal density), D. thomasi disappeared from the water column, but fourth-instar copepodids (CIV) were found encysted in developmental arrest in the sediment. Laboratory assays of the effect of the density of two types of food on copepod life history parameters showed that temporal variation in the concentration of relatively small phytoflagellates significantly affected stage-specific development times. This food limitation was most pronounced during the clear-water phase, and supplementation of the diet with a laboratory-cultured phytoflagellate, Chlamydomonas, prevented food limitation. Although developmental arrest appears to be controlled primarily by photoperiod, availability of the larger, more mobile food, Euglena, also influenced the percentage of individuals entering developmental arrest in the laboratory. An investigation of the spatial and temporal emergence pattern in the field revealed that CIV copepodids started to emerge in late autumn and that emergence rates were significantly greater at deep-water locations (9-12 m water depth) compared with shallow-water locations (5-7 m). The clear-water phase in Oneida Lake is an annual event, probably produced by intense grazing by Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia galeata. Food limitation is thus very likely a recurrent phenomenon for D. thomasi. This apparent seasonal competitive impact of Daphnia on Diacyclops affects both nauplii and immature copepodids. Diacyclops shows two types of responses to the food limitation: (1) the physiological response of slowed active development, and (2) the adaptive response of developmental arrest.},

The specific growth rate (SGR) of rotifers fed Asteromonas (maximum 0.79) was statistically higher than that for rotifers fed Chlorella (maximium 0.61). The filtration and ingestion rates using different rotifer and algal densities exhibited certain maxima depending on the species, the cell density and the condition of the rotifers. The filtration rate was higher with Asteromonas and, although ingestion rate was lower than with Chlorella, the ingestion in terms of cell volume was 10-fold higher. It seems that B. plicatilis ingests the larger cell diameter algal species more efficiently than the smaller species that is usually used for its mass culture.},

	abstract = {Filamentous green algae (FGA) often proliferate in nutrient-rich rivers under low flow conditions. We assessed the hydrological and meteorological variables controlling the occurrence and composition of FGA in Lac Saint-Pierre (LSP), the largest of the St. Lawrence River fluvial lakes. We hypothesized that, under nutrient-rich conditions, hydrology and climate would be the main drivers of FGA occurrence and composition. We tested this hypothesis during the 2005 growing season, by fortnightly sampling at 7 stations within Anse-du-Fort, a 9 km2 LSP embayment chronically exposed to the inflow of two tributaries draining farmland. Cladophora was the prevalent genus (89\% occurrence), but Oedogonium, Hydrodictyon, and Spirogyra were at times dominant. Hydrological (depth, water level change) and meteorological variables (hours of sunshine, wind velocity) were the best predictors of FGA occurrence (r2 = 0.55), but no water quality variable was significant in any model. The generality of our findings was then assessed using lake-wide FGA occurrence from surveys conducted over 6 years (2000–2001 and 2005–2008) of widely different hydrological and climatic conditions. Years of low water levels (2001 and 2007) coincided with early occurrence, highest prevalence and longest seasonal FGA persistence. Validation of model predictions using remote sensing images yielded a 74\% success rate in forecasting FGA. We identified a water level limit for FGA occurrence (\&lt; 4.07 m above sea level). This limit provides a simple operational guideline for managers, improving our ability to predict FGA proliferation under increasingly low discharge and warming climatic conditions forecasted for the St. Lawrence River.},

	abstract = {One of the major challenges for agriculture is to understand the effects of agricultural practices on soil properties and diffuse pollution, to support practical farm-scale land management. Three conventionally managed grassland fields with similar short-term management, but different ploughing histories, were studied on a long-term research platform: the North Wyke Farm Platform. The aims were to (i) quantify the between-field and within-field spatial variation in soil properties by geostatistical analysis, (ii) understand the effects of soil condition (in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon contents) on the quality of discharge water and (iii) establish robust baseline data before the implementation of various grassland management scenarios. Although the fields sampled had experienced the same land use and similar management for at least 6 years, there were differences in their mean soil properties. They showed different patterns of soil spatial variation and different rates of diffuse nutrient losses to water. The oldest permanent pasture field had the largest soil macronutrient concentrations and the greatest diffuse nutrient losses. We show that management histories affect soil properties and diffuse losses. Potential gains in herbage yield or benefits in water quality might be achieved by characterizing every field or by area-specific management within fields (a form of precision agriculture for grasslands). Permanent pasture per se cannot be considered a mitigation measure for diffuse pollution. The between- and within-field soil spatial variation emphasizes the importance of baseline characterization and will enable the reliable identification of any effects of future management change on the Farm Platform.


Highlights




* Quantification of soil and water quality in grassland fields with contrasting management histories.

* Considerable spatial variation in soil properties and diffuse losses between and within fields.

* Contrasting management histories within and between fields strongly affected soil and water quality.

* Careful pasture management needed: the oldest pasture transferred the most nutrients from soil to water.},

The model was used to simulate changes in stream flow and nutrient loads under a transient climate change scenario for each watershed. Under an assumption of no change in land cover and land management, the model was used to predict monthly changes in stream flow and nutrient loads for future climate conditions. Mean annual stream flow and nutrient loads increased for most watersheds, but decreased in one watershed that was intensively cultivated. Nutrient loading slightly decreased in April and late summer for several watersheds as a result of early snowmelt and increasing evapotranspiration. Spatial and temporal variability of stream flow and nutrient loads under the transient climate scenario indicates that different approaches for future water resource management may be useful.},

These changes interact with climate and aquatic ecosystem processes to alter nutrient flux dynamics. We used a long term data set (1993–2009) to investigate the influence of suburbanization, climate, and in-stream processes on nitrogen and phosphorus export in rivers draining the Ipswich and Parker River watersheds in northeastern MA, USA. During this timeframe population density increased in these watersheds by 14 \% while precipitation varied by 46 \%. We compared nutrient export patterns from the two larger watersheds with those from two nested headwater catchments collected over a nine year period (2001–2009). The headwater catchments were of contrasting, but stable, land uses that dominate the larger watersheds (suburban and forested). Despite ongoing land use change and an increase in population density in the mainstem watersheds, we did not detect an increase in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) or PO4 concentration or export over the 16-year time period. Inter-annual climate and associated runoff variability was the major control. Annual DIN and PO4 export increased with greater annual precipitation in the Ipswich and the Parker River watersheds, as well as the forested headwater catchment. In contrast, annual DIN export fluxes from the suburban headwater catchment were less affected by precipitation variability, with inter-annual export fluxes negatively correlated with mean annual temperature. The larger watershed exports diverged from headwater exports, particularly during summer, low-flow periods, suggesting retention of DIN and PO4. Our study shows suburban headwater exports respond to inter-annual variation in runoff and climate differently than forested headwater exports, but the impacts from headwater streams could be buffered by the river network. The net effect is that inter-annual variation and network buffering can mitigate higher nutrient exports from larger suburbanizing watersheds over decadal time periods.},

	abstract = {Plankton form the base of the food chain in the ocean and are fundamental to marine ecosystem dynamics. The rapid mapping of plankton abundance together with taxonomic and size composition is very important for ocean environmental research, but difficult or impossible to accomplish using traditional techniques. In this paper, we present a new pattern recognition system to classify large numbers of plankton images detected in real time by the Video Plankton Recorder (VPR), a towed underwater video microscope system. The difficulty of such classification is compounded because: 1) underwater images are typically very noisy, 2) many plankton objects are in partial occlusion, 3) the objects are deformable and 4) images are projection variant, i.e., the images are video records of three-dimensional objects in arbitrary positions and orientations. Our approach combines traditional invariant moment features and Fourier boundary descriptors with gray-scale morphological granulometries to form a feature vector capturing both shape and texture information of plankton images. With an improved learning vector quantization network classifier, we achieve 95\% classification accuracy on six plankton taxa taken from nearly 2,000 images. This result is comparable with what a trained biologist can achieve by using conventional manual techniques, making possible for the first time a fully automated, at sea-approach to real-time mapping of plankton populations.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, the automatic study and analysis of plankton communities using imaging techniques has advanced significantly. The effectiveness of these automated systems appears to have improved, reaching acceptable levels of accuracy. However, plankton ecologists often find that classification systems do not work as well as expected when applied to new samples. This paper proposes a methodology to assess the efficacy of learned models which takes into account the fact that the data distribution (the plankton composition of the sample) can vary between the model building phase and the production phase. As opposed to most validation methods that consider the individual organism as the unit of validation, our approach uses a validation-by-sample, which is more appropriate when the objective is to estimate the abundance of different morphological groups. We argue that, in these cases, the base unit to correctly estimate the error is the sample, not the individual. Thus, model assessment processes require groups of samples with sufficient variability in order to provide precise error estimates.},

	abstract = {Plankton imaging systems are capable of providing fine-scale observations that enhance our understanding of key physical and biological processes. However, processing the large volumes of data collected by imaging systems remains a major obstacle for their employment, and existing approaches are designed either for images acquired under laboratory controlled conditions or within clear waters. In the present study, we developed a semi-automated approach to analyze plankton taxa from images acquired by the ZOOplankton VISualization (ZOOVIS) system within turbid estuarine waters, in Chesapeake Bay. When compared to images under laboratory controlled conditions or clear waters, images from highly turbid waters are often of relatively low quality and more variable, due to the large amount of objects and nonlinear illumination within each image. We first customized a segmentation procedure to locate objects within each image and extracted them for classification. A maximally stable extremal regions algorithm was applied to segment large gelatinous zooplankton and an adaptive threshold approach was developed to segment small organisms, such as copepods. Unlike the existing approaches for images acquired from laboratory, controlled conditions or clear waters, the target objects are often the majority class, and the classification can be treated as a multi-class classification problem. We customized a two-level hierarchical classification procedure using support vector machines to classify the target objects ({\textless} 5\%), and remove the non-target objects ({\textgreater} 95\%). First, histograms of oriented gradients feature descriptors were constructed for the segmented objects. In the first step all non-target and target objects were classified into different groups: arrow-like, copepod-like, and gelatinous zooplankton. Each object was passed to a group-specific classifier to remove most non-target objects. After the object was classified, an expert or non-expert then manually removed the non-target objects that could not be removed by the procedure. The procedure was tested on 89,419 images collected in Chesapeake Bay, and results were consistent with visual counts with {\textgreater}80\% accuracy for all three groups.},

	abstract = {Plankton are a diverse group of organisms that live in large bodies of water. They are a major souce of food for fishes and other larger aquatic organisms. The distribution of plankton plays an important role in the marine ecosystem. The study of plankton distribution relies heavily on classification of plankton images taken by underwater imaging systems. Since plankton are very different in terms of both size and shape; plankton image classification poses a significant challenge. In this paper we proposed the use of hybrid classification algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). In particular, we provide an in depth comparison of the experimental results of CNN with Support Vector Machine and CNN with Random Forest. Unlike traditional image classification techniques these hybrid CNN based approaches do not rely on features engineering and can be efficiently scaled up to include new classes. Our experimental results on the SIPPER dataset show improvement in classification accuracy over the state of the art approaches.},

Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients—manually annotated by up to four raters—and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74\%–85\%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more eﬃciently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

	abstract = {This paper introduces a network for volumetric segmentation that learns from sparsely annotated volumetric images. We outline two attractive use cases of this method: (1) In a semi-automated setup, the user annotates some slices in the volume to be segmented. The network learns from these sparse annotations and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-ﬂy elastic deformations for eﬃcient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases.},

The proposed 3D DSN takes advantage of a fully convolutional architecture which performs eﬃcient end-to-end learning and inference. More importantly, we introduce a deep supervision mechanism during the learning process to combat potential optimization diﬃculties, and thus the model can acquire a much faster convergence rate and more powerful discrimination capability. On top of the high-quality score map produced by the 3D DSN, a conditional random ﬁeld model is further employed to obtain reﬁned segmentation results. We evaluated our framework on the public MICCAI-SLiver07 dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method achieves competitive segmentation results to state-of-the-art approaches with a much faster processing speed.},

Most current methods rely on very well-designed features for this new 3D modality. We introduce a model based on a combination of convolutional and recursive neural networks (CNN and RNN) for learning features and classifying RGB-D images. The CNN layer learns low-level translationally invariant features which are then given as inputs to multiple, ﬁxed-tree RNNs in order to compose higher order features. RNNs can be seen as combining convolution and pooling into one efﬁcient, hierarchical operation. Our main result is that even RNNs with random weights compose powerful features. Our model obtains state of the art performance on a standard RGB-D object dataset while being more accurate and faster during training and testing than comparable architectures such as two-layer CNNs.},

Our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3D occupancy grid. Unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework i) outperforms the state-of-theart methods for single view reconstruction, and ii) enables the 3D reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional SFM/SLAM methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).},

We furthermore take part in the survival prediction subchallenge by training an ensemble of a random forest regressor and a multilayer perceptron ensemble on shape features describing the tumor subregions. Our ensemble achieves 335.08 root mean squared error (232.76 mean absolute error) in a ﬁve fold cross-validation over the 163 training cases.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a network for volumetric segmentation that learns from sparsely annotated volumetric images. We outline two attractive use cases of this method: (1) In a semi-automated setup, the user annotates some slices in the volume to be segmented. The network learns from these sparse annotations and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-ﬂy elastic deformations for eﬃcient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases.},

Most current methods rely on very well-designed features for this new 3D modality. We introduce a model based on a combination of convolutional and recursive neural networks (CNN and RNN) for learning features and classifying RGB-D images. The CNN layer learns low-level translationally invariant features which are then given as inputs to multiple, ﬁxed-tree RNNs in order to compose higher order features. RNNs can be seen as combining convolution and pooling into one efﬁcient, hierarchical operation. Our main result is that even RNNs with random weights compose powerful features. Our model obtains state of the art performance on a standard RGB-D object dataset while being more accurate and faster during training and testing than comparable architectures such as two-layer CNNs.},

The proposed 3D DSN takes advantage of a fully convolutional architecture which performs eﬃcient end-to-end learning and inference. More importantly, we introduce a deep supervision mechanism during the learning process to combat potential optimization diﬃculties, and thus the model can acquire a much faster convergence rate and more powerful discrimination capability. On top of the high-quality score map produced by the 3D DSN, a conditional random ﬁeld model is further employed to obtain reﬁned segmentation results. We evaluated our framework on the public MICCAI-SLiver07 dataset.

Our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3D occupancy grid. Unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework i) outperforms the state-of-theart methods for single view reconstruction, and ii) enables the 3D reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional SFM/SLAM methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).},

Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients—manually annotated by up to four raters—and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74\%–85\%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.},

	abstract = {Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States (US) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000–2015, contributed to 75\% more forested area experiencing high ({\textgreater}1 σ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for ∼55\% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984–2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.},

	abstract = {Effects of climate warming on natural and human systems are becoming increasingly visible across the globe. For example, the shattering of past yearly records for global high temperatures seems to be a near-annual event, with the five hottest years since 1880 all occurring since 2005 (1). Not coincidentally, the single hottest year on record, 2015, also broke records for area burned by wildfire in the United States (Fig. 1 A and B ), eclipsing the previous high mark set just one decade prior (2). Scientists have known for some time that climate is a key driver of forest fires; records from the past and present (3⇓–5) provide strong evidence that warmer temperatures are associated with spikes in fire activity. Therefore, recent increases in wildfire activity as the planet warms are not a surprise. However, just how much of the recent increases in forest fire activity can be attributed to human-caused climate change vs. natural variability in climate? This question has profound scientific, management, and policy implications, yet answers have thus far remained elusive. In PNAS, Abatzoglou and Williams (6) present strong evidence that human-caused climate change is increasing wildfire activity across wide swaths of forested land in the western United States. They demonstrate that human-caused climate change has lengthened the annual fire season (i.e., the window of time each year with weather that is conducive to forest fires) and, since 1984, has doubled the cumulative area in the western United States that would have otherwise burned due to natural climate forcing alone. …

	abstract = {The uptake of resources from the environment is a vital process for all organisms. Many experimental studies have revealed that the rate at which this process occurs depends critically on the resource concentration, a relationship called "functional response." However, whether the concentration of the consumer normally affects the functional response has been the subject of a long-standing, predominantly theoretical, debate in ecology. Here we present an experimental test between the alternative hypotheses that food uptake depends either only on the resource concentration or on both the resource and the consumer concentrations. In short-term laboratory experiments, we measured the uptake of radioactively labeled, unicellular green algae (Monoraphidium minutum, resource) by the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus (a consumer) for varying combinations of resource and consumer concentrations. We found that the food uptake by Brachionus depended on the algal concentration with the relationship best described by a Holling type 3 functional response. We detected significant consumer effects on the functional response only at an extraordinarily high Brachionus density (- 125 rotifers/mL), which by far exceeds concentrations normally encountered in the field. We conclude that consumer-dependent food uptake by planktonic rotifers is a phenomenon that can occur under extreme conditions, but probably plays a minor role in natural environments.},

	abstract = {Although salinity and aquatic biodiversity are inversely related in lake water, the relationship between types of salts and zooplankton communities is poorly understood. In this study, zooplankton species were related to environmental variables from 12 lakes: three saline lakes with water where the dominant anions were SO4 and CO3, four saline lakes with Cl-dominated water, and ﬁve dilute, subsaline (0.5–3 gl−1 total dissolved solids) lakes of variable anion composition. Although this study comprised only 12 lakes, distinct differences in zooplankton communities were observed among the two groups of chemically deﬁned saline lakes. Canonical correspondence analysis identiﬁed total alkalinity, sulphate, chloride, calcium, sodium, potassium, and total phosphorus as all contributing to the ﬁrst two ordination axes (λ1 = 0.97 and λ2 = 0.62, P {\textless} 0.05). The rotifer Brachionus plicatilis and the harpactacoid copepod Cletocamptus sp. prevailed lakes with Cl-dominated water. In contrast, the calanoid copepods Leptodiaptomus sicilis and Diaptomus nevadensis were dominant in the SO4/CO3-dominated lake water with elevated potassium (79–128 mg l−1) and total phosphorus concentrations (1322-2915 µg l−1). The contrasting zooplankton species distribution among these two saline lake types is likely explained by variable selective pressure on zooplankton and their predators from differing physiological tolerances to salt stress and speciﬁc ions. While inland saline lakes with Cl as the dominant anion are relatively rare in Canada and SO4/CO3 are the common features, our study provided an opportunity to compare zooplankton communities across the two groups of lakes.},

Furthermore, although grazing sub-optimally, the rotifer grazed with an equal efﬁciency (60\%) on two different algae Rhodomonas baltica (R.b.) and Thalassiosira ﬂuviatilis (T.f.) with equivalent spherical diameters of 6.5 mm and 12.9 mm, respectively, when they were offered one algae at a time. These two algal species were in size positioned symmetrically in the bell shaped curve around the optimal prey size for the rotifers. In mixtures of these two algal species the total grazing on the two algae remained equal regardless of the ratio between the two species in the mixtures. The functional responses to the two algal species offered separately resulted in similar maximum ingestion (Imax) but different half saturation constants (Km).},

	abstract = {Chlorella autotrophica shows a major decline in the intracellular concentrations of glutamine synthetase (GS) isoenzymes, GS1 and GS2, and a marked increase in the concentration of NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) when nitrate is replaced by ammonium as the sole nitrogen source. NADH-dependent GDH shows very little change under these conditions. The apparent Km for ammonium of both GS isoenzymes is around 50 /tM and that of NADPH-GDH is around 15 mm. There is little change in the latter when the NADPH concentration in the assay medium is decreased, or when cells are harvested at different growth phases. In vitro kinetic analysis of GS1 and GS2 indicate low affinities of these isoenzymes for substrates other than ammonium. Both GS1 and GS2 require about 10 mm ATP, 20 mm Mg2" and 70 mm glutamate for maximum activities. The rate response curves obtained for GS2 show nonlinear kinetics for glutamate and Mg2". The double reciprocal plots for activity vs. substrate concentration for GS2 show dual kinetics with respect to glutamate concentrations, with a low Km value of about 10 mm and a high Km value of 40 mm. The rate response curve for GS2 for Mg2" is sigmoidal. The Km values for glutamate measured for aspartate aminotransferase (AsAT) and alanine aminotransferase (AlAT) are in the same range as those measured for the two GS isoenzymes. The algal aminotransferases have very low Km values (18-55 ,UM)for 2-oxoglutarate.},

Its taxonomic status has been recently re-de¢ned as a species complex, consisting of at least 14 new species/lineages. This study deals with the lineage Brachionus ‘Nevada’, which has been shown to occur in European hatcheries. A strain of B.‘Nevada’ was mass cultured using two commonly applied feeding regimes and analysed in terms of its morphometry. A new formula was proposed for the calculation of volume, which can be used as an index of adequacy of rotifers as feed for ¢sh larvae. The results were related to life cycle parameters. The pre-reproductive and reproductive phases were divided into distinct size groups. Di¡erences were also found between the two diets in morphometry and demography. Rotifers of a larger size (yeast-based diet) showed a lower growth rate and a longer reproductive period, lifespan and mean generation time compared with smaller-sized rotifers s (Culture Selco -based diet). In terms of lorica length, the present study’s strain of B. ‘Nevada’ (238.5 mm) was intermediate between values reported for Brachionus ibericus (193.5 mm) and B. plicatilis sensu stricto (299 mm).},

The effect of salinity is also genetically dependent; the highest r for each clone is observed at the salinity close to that of its environmental origin. The response of r to temperature is mainly a consequence of the response of the individual rates of development and reproductive timing. The effect of temperature on fecundity (number of descendents per individual life time) is negligible when temperature values are within the normal habitat ranges. On the other hand, salinity seems to affect primarily fecundity. The interaction salinity-temperature may be important in clones or species living in fluctuating environments with positive response to the more frequent combinations found in the corresponding habitats.},

Herein, we examined the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) on both prey and predator by letting one predatory reef ﬁsh interact for 24 h with eight small or large juvenile damselﬁshes from four congeneric species. Both prey and predator were exposed to control or elevated levels of CO2. Mortality rate and predator selectivity were compared across CO2 treatments, prey size and species. Small juveniles of all species sustained greater mortality at high CO2 levels, while large recruits were not affected. For large prey, the pattern of prey selectivity by predators was reversed under elevated CO2. Our results demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative consumptive effects of CO2 on small and larger damselﬁsh recruits respectively, resulting from CO2-induced behavioural changes likely mediated by impaired neurological function. This study highlights the complexity of predicting the effects of climate change on coral reef ecosystems.},

This understanding, however, is based primarily on theoretical considerations and the applicability of existing concepts of co-limitation has rarely been tested experimentally. Here, we assessed the suitability of two contrasting concepts of resource limitation, i.e. LiebigÕs minimum rule and the multiple limitation hypothesis, to describe nutrient-dependent growth responses of a freshwater herbivore (Daphnia magna) in a system with two potentially limiting nutrients (cholesterol and eicosapentaenoic acid). The results indicated that these essential nutrients interact, and do not strictly follow LiebigÕs minimum rule, which consistently overestimates growth at co-limiting conditions and thus is not applicable to describe multiple nutrient limitation of herbivorous consumers. We infer that the outcome of resource-based modelling approaches assessing herbivore population dynamics strongly depends on the applied concept of co-limitation.},

As predicted, we found declines in both specialist herbivores and predators near edges, but, contrary to expectations, this was not driven by gradients in plant resources. Instead, the increase in generalist predators near edges offers one alternative explanation for the observed declines. Furthermore, our results suggest how recent advances in food web theory could improve resource-based edge models, and vice versa.},

	abstract = {Intrinsic rates of population increase (r) were evaluated as a measure of population dynamics of four strains of Brachionus plicatilis and two strains of B. urceolaris from Iran in response to different salinities and feeding algae. Each rotifer strain was cultured at four salinities: 5, 20, 25 and 30‰ and fed with two microalgal species: Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis oculata. Salinity of 5‰ was critical for all the examined strains, at which r was at minimum and was different from the other salinities (P {\textless} 0.05). For B. plicatilis strains, the maximum r was observed in those fed on Chlorella at salinities of 10 and 30‰ (64 ± 0.01 day−1). While, in B. urceolaris, maximum r was for Nannochloropsis fed rotifers at salinity of 20‰ (0.69 ± 0.01 day−1). Maximum final population density (FD) was obtained for a strain of B. urceolaris fed on Nannochloropsis at 20‰ (329.3 ± 10.9 ind.mL−1). FD was relatively lower in B. plicatilis strains among all examined salinities. ANOVA showed the significant effect of salinity and rotifer strain, and algae × rotifer strain on both r and FD, and salinity × rotifer × algae on FD (P {\textless} 0.05).},

Speciﬁc growth rate (SGR), maximum density, and duration to reach maximum density of C. ellipsoidea were signiﬁcantly affected by both temperature and salinity. The highest SGR was observed in C. ellipsoidea at 25°C and salinity 10, but the maximum density was very low. The highest maximum density was achieved in C. ellipsoidea at 15°C and 10. The slope constant of the linear relationship between semilogarithmic growth of C. ellipsoidea and day of culture was highest at 15°C and 10. The SGR and duration to reach maximum density of N. oculata were signiﬁcantly affected by both temperature and salinity. However, maximum density of N. oculata was signiﬁcantly affected by temperature, but not salinity. The highest maximum density was achieved in N. oculata at 25°C and 30, but SGR was signiﬁcantly lower than that of N. oculata at 25°C and 10. The slope constant of the linear relationship between semilogarithmic growth of N. oculata and day of culture was highest at 25°C and 30. Based on these results, the condition of 15°C and salinity 10 seemed to be optimal for maximum density of C. ellipsoidea, and the condition of 25°C and 10 and 30 for SGR and maximum density for N. oculata, respectively.},

A model involving three primary life history strategies (endpoints on a triangular surface) describes general patterns of variation more comprehensively than schemes that examine single traits or merely contrast fast versus slow life histories. It provides a general means to predict a priori the types of populations with high or low demographic resilience, production potential, and conformity to density-dependent regulation. Periodic (long-lived, high fecundity, high recruitment variation) and opportunistic (small, short-lived, high reproductive effort, high demographic resilience) strategies should conform poorly to models that assume density-dependent recruitment. Periodic-type species reveal greatest recruitment variation and compensatory reserve, but with poor conformity to stock–recruitment models. Equilibriumtype populations (low fecundity, large egg size, parental care) should conform better to assumptions of densitydependent recruitment, but have lower demographic resilience. The model’s predictions are explored relative to sustainable harvest, endangered species conservation, supplemental stocking, and transferability of ecological indices. When detailed information is lacking, species ordination according to the triangular model provides qualitative guidance for management and development of more detailed predictive models.},

The former consists of the following components: Perceptual field (in planktonic rotifers the area of the corona), swimming rate, and attack rate. The second class consists of capture rate, handling time, rejection rate, ingestion, digestion, and assimilation. All evidence indicates that the perceptual field cannot be varied by the rotifer. Swimming rate is variable and under rotifer control, but does not appear to vary with degree of starvation. Attack rate is also under control of the rotifer, at least in the genus Asplanchna. Capture rates vary with the species of food item from zero to 100\%. Handling times are longer than one would expect, as are rejection times. Digestion and assimilation appear to vary inversely with rate of ingestion. There is some suggestion in the literature that feeding behavior on very small particles differs from that on larger ones.},

Results indicate marked effects of both grazing and nutrient loading on phytoplankton abundance and composition, N-ﬁxing cyanobacteria presence and N-ﬁxing heterocyst density. When we manipulated N:P using two different N loading regimes at high P loading, grazer and N:P loading effects on cyanobacteria were similar in magnitude. In contrast when N:P loading was kept high while P loading was varied, grazer effects on cyanobacteria were small relative to nutrient loading effects. Aggregate grazer effects appeared to result exclusively from direct removal of cyanobacteria by grazing. Indirect alteration of available N:P by zooplankton was minor in magnitude compared with external and internal nutrient loading. Ecological interactions that structure zooplankton assemblages, such as ﬁsh predation, can have substantial cascading effects not only on primary producer biomass, but also on phytoplankton taxonomic composition and ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {The rotifer Brachionus plicatilis is euryhaline (growing between 2 and 97 ppt) and has previously been considered an osmoconformer. We suggest that B. plicatilis is an osmoregulator, exhibiting a pattern of Na+/ K+ ATPase activity in response to salinity consistent with that of other osmoregulating euryhaline invertebrates. To examine salinity tolerance, growth rates between 5 and 60 ppt were determined. The activity of Na+/K+ ATPase was examined, over the same range of salinities, by measuring ATPase activity in rotifer homogenates in the presence and absence of a Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor. Maximum speciﬁc growth rate (0.95 dayÀ1) occurred at 16 ppt, highest mean amictic eggs per female (1.41) occurred at 20 ppt, and both parameters decreased rapidly as salinity increased. Egg development time was constant with salinity at 0.92 days. The activity of Na+/K+ ATPase per milligram protein increased from 3.9 lmol hÀ1 at 5 ppt to 6.8 lmol hÀ1 at 50 ppt and accounted for 15 and 30\% of total ATPase activity, respectively. We suggest that these observations are consistent with increasing stress at high salinities and the occurrence of a hypo-osmoregulatory response. Given the high ATP consumption of Na+/K+ ATPase at high salinities, it is possible that a proportion of the corresponding decreases in growth rate and egg production are a direct cost of regulation.},

	abstract = {We study the qualitative properties of population cycles in a predator–prey system where genetic variability allows contemporary rapid evolution of the prey. Previous numerical studies have found that prey evolution in response to changing predation risk can have major quantitative and qualitative effects on predator–prey cycles, including: (1) large increases in cycle period, (2) changes in phase relations (so that predator and prey are cycling exactly out of phase, rather than the classical quarter-period phase lag), and (3) “cryptic” cycles in which total prey density remains nearly constant while predator density and prey traits cycle. Here we focus on a chemostat model motivated by our experimental system (Fussmann et al. in Science 290:1358–1360, 2000; Yoshida et al. in Proc roy Soc Lond B 424:303–306, 2003) with algae (prey) and rotifers (predators), in which the prey exhibit rapid evolution in their level of defense against predation. We show that the effects of rapid prey evolution are robust and general, and furthermore that they occur in a speciﬁc but biologically relevant region of parameter space: when traits that greatly reduce predation risk are relatively cheap (in terms of reductions in other ﬁtness components), when there is coexistence between the two prey types and the predator, and when the interaction between predators and undefended prey alone would produce cycles. Because defense has been shown to be inexpensive, even cost-free, in a number of systems (Andersson et al. in Curr Opin Microbiol 2:489–493, 1999: Gagneux et al. in Science 312:1944–1946, 2006; Yoshida et al. in Proc Roy Soc Lond B 271:1947–1953, 2004), our discoveries may well be reproduced in other model systems, and in nature. Finally, some of our key results are extended to a general model in which functional forms for the predation rate and prey birth rate are not speciﬁed.},

The average daily increasing rates of population were 0.076 ± 0.001, 0.065 ± 0.002, 0.055 ± 0.002 and 0.048 ± 0.003 for D. celebensis fed 1×106 cell/mL and inoculated at 100, 200, 300 and 400 ind./L, respectively, and 0.098 ± 0.001, 0.078 ± 0.002, 0.072 ± 0.003 and 0.067 ± 0.003 for D. celebensis fed 3 × 106 cell/mL and inoculated at 100, 200, 300 and 400 ind./L, respectively. The maximum population density and average daily increasing rate of population increased as the algal concentration increased, whereas an increase in the inoculation density led to a linear decrease in the daily increasing rate of population under both algal concentrations. The results of the present experiment indicate that the algal concentration and inoculation density significantly affect population growth of D. celebensis. Furthermore, the results suggest that the optimal algal concentration and inoculation density for the mass culture of D. celebensis should be 3 × 106 cell/mL and 100 ind./L.},

The relative viscosity ranged from 1.054 to 1.148. We observed a negative correlation between population growth rate and viscosity. We experimentally tested the effect of viscosity on reproduction, swimming activity and ingestion rate of Brachionus plicatilis. By dissolving methyl cellulose, the relative viscosity of natural sea water (salinity 22 ppt) was increased from 1.0 (control group) to 1.022, 1.031, 1.078 and 1.169. At higher viscosity, individually cultured rotifers at 25 ◦C that were fed Nannochloropsis oculata showed slower swimming, lower ingestion rate and lower fecundity than control. By increasing the relative viscosity from 1 to 1.169, the swimming activity index decreased from 28.3 to 4.9 (1 mm2 square grids/30 s), the ingestion rate decreased from 1.13 to 0.34 (×103 cells ind−1 h−1), and the number of offspring per amictic female decreased from 20.8 ± 3.0 to 8.1 ± 3.7 (mean ± SD).},

Reduced food levels, as well as temperature and salinity extremes, reduced reproduction of both sexual and asexual females, but did so differentially. Reproduction by sexual females was reduced to a greater extent at environmental extremes than asexual females. The broad, flat reproductive response curve of asexual females extended beyond the limits of the narrower, more sharply peaked curve of sexual females. Thus zones of exclusively asexual reproduction exist at environmental extremes where sexual reproduction is physiologically restricted. These results are corroborated by a comparison of the lifetime fecundity of individual sexual and asexual females over a 20 {\textasciitilde} temperature range. No differences in lifetime fecundity occurred between sexual and asexual females at 18{\textasciitilde} and 28{\textasciitilde} At 38{\textasciitilde} however, asexual female fecundity reached its highest level, while sexual female fecundity declined 15\%. The appearance of sexual females in rotifer populations is the result of both inducible and repressible factors.},

The population growth experiments were conducted for 3 weeks. Both the rotifer species did not survive beyond one week at a salinity of 0 g l−1. Regardless of salt concentration and the presence of a competitor, H. jenkinae reached higher densities than B. rotundiformis. When grown alone, both B. rotundiformis and H. jenkinae showed optimal peak population densities at the salinity of 6 and 9 g l−1. Since biomass wise, B. rotundiformis was larger than H. jenkinae, it showed a lower numerical abundance. Thus, the maximum peak population densities of B. rotundiformis and H. jenkinae recorded in this study were 107±3 and 203±28 ind. ml−1. The maximal rates of population increase for B. rotundiformis and H, jenkinae when grown alone were 0.264±0.003 and 0.274±0.004, respectively. Our results also indicated that B. rotundiformis and H. jenkinae coexisted better at a salinity of 6 and 9 g l−1 of sodium chloride while a salinity of 3 g l−1 favoured Hexarthra over B. rotundiformis. At 12 g l−1, both the rotifer species grown alone or together showed lower growth rates compared to those at lower salinity levels. Except 0 g l−1, in all other salinity treatments, H. jenkinae was a superior competitor to B. rotundiformis.},

Nearly 30\% of the time series were cyclic. Cycle incidence varied among taxonomic classes, being most common in mammal and fish populations, but only in fish did cycle incidence vary among orders. Cycles were equally common in European and North American populations, but were more common in Atlantic fish than Pacific fish. The incidence of cycles increased with latitude in mammals only. There was no latitudinal gradient in cycle period, but cycle amplitude declined with latitude in some groups of fish.

The results are a beginning toward answering some of the theoretical questions presented to population ecologists. The present data indicate that if an adequate environment is encompassed, the predator-prey relation is not necessarily self-annihilative, and that absolutely restrictive refuges are not essential. The results also support the view that more stable control of a population is likely to result in an environment of balanced heterogeneity than in one of simpler structure. In this study a predator-prey relation was maintained for three successive oscillation waves before overexploitation finally ended the relation in the most complex universe or ecosystem utilized. Some of the questions which may ultimately be answered by such studies include: Are such oscillations inherently of increasing amplitude? If so, are there commonly present forces which act to cancel this tendency? Does the presence of other significant species in addition to the two original coactors tend to stabilize or disturb the relation? What may be the effect of changes in the physical conditions upon the degree of stability or permanence of the relation? Can evidence be obtained regarding the concept that the prey, as well as the predator, may benefit from the relation? What is the order of influence on stability of such factors as shelter, food, disease, and natural enemies of other kinds?},

In different studies (Zitzler and Thiele 1999; Zitzler, Deb, and Thiele 2000) SPEA has shown very good performance in comparison to other multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, and therefore it has been a point of reference in various recent investigations, e.g., (Corne, Knowles, and Oates 2000). Furthermore, it has been used in different applications, e.g., (Lahanas, Milickovic, Baltas, and Zamboglou 2001). In this paper, an improved version, namely SPEA2, is proposed, which incorporates in contrast to its predecessor a ﬁne-grained ﬁtness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation method. The comparison of SPEA2 with SPEA and two other modern elitist methods, PESA and NSGA-II, on different test problems yields promising results.},

Principle shortcomings of the concept of mutative strategy parameter control and two levels of derandomization are reviewed. Basic demands on the self-adaptation of arbitrary (normal) mutation distributions are developed. Applying arbitrary, normal mutation distributions is equivalent to applying a general, linear problem encoding.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate whether a stage-structured population model can explain major features of dynamics of the herbivores Daphnia galeata and Bosmina longirostris reared under controlled laboratory conditions. Model parameters are determined from independent individual-based information gleaned from the literature on feeding, growth, reproduction, and survivorship of these herbivores. We tested predictions of our model against published observations on the dynamics of laboratory populations. The feeding protocols used in these experiments present a highly dynamic food environment that rigorously challenges the ability of stage-structured models to predict the dynamics of populations as they approach equilibrium. For both herbivore species, the models correctly predict feasible equilibria and some features of their dynamics (e.g., periodicity, cycle amplitude, demography, and fecundity) for experiments in which the species were raised in isolation and food transfers were relatively frequent (at least one transfer per instar). With frequent food transfers, the model also correctly predicts coexistence of the herbivores during competition experiments and suggests a novel mechanism for coexistence. The model fails to predict correctly single-species dynamics and the outcome of competition in experiments where food transfers were infrequent and utilization of internal reserves by individuals in the populations must have been high.},

	abstract = {Patterns of growth, development, and reproduction have been observed in many Daphnia species, and there have been some attempts to explain them using models that take into account rates of intake, assimilation, maintenance, and energy allocation rules. We show, however, that existing models cannot capture some essential features of individual growth, especially under conditions of low food supply that are typical of field conditions. These features include: (1) a sigmoid growth curve, and (2) the time to starvation or the performance of individuals during periods of low food availability. We propose and test a new hypothesis based on the idea that allometric relationship for physiological rates are stage dependent. We show that ingestion rates increase much faster with juvenile body size than with adult body size for several Daphnia species. Existing data suggest that allometric relationships for respiration are not stage dependent, and we derive a maintenance function that takes into account overheads associated with growth and basal metabolic rates. The new allometric relationships for ingestion and maintenance, along with an accurate description of the onset of maturity and partitioning of energy between growth and reproduction, can account for the sigmoid growth pattern displayed by Daphnia. Existing models cannot explain Daphnia's performance when food availability is low, and this led us to examine how Daphnia stores energy and uses reserves. Our review synthesizes disparate observations on the structure and dynamics of reserves, and forms the basis for a new model of Daphnia pulex.},

In the field, the freshwater zooplankter Daphnia appears to live for extended periods at very low food levels. While Daphnia is one of the most well-studied organisms, there are few data on the performance of individuals receiving food supplies that resemble field levels. We present results from experiments on a single clone of D. pulex Leydig that illustrate the food dependence in growth, development, reproduction, and survivorship. These results show that allocation among competing processes of reproduction and growth can be modified by the pattern of food supply and that food dependence in maturation delays provide support for the hypothesis that cycles in the abundance of Daphnia field populations are `single-generation' cycles.},

	abstract = {STABLE predator–prey models with a tension between the stabilizing effect of prey density-dependence and the destabilizing effect of predators generally become unstable when the nutrient environment of the prey is enriched1–3. This 'paradox of enrichment' occurs in a wide range of models incorporating realistic features4–6. Enriched models quickly produce cycles with enormous amplitude and increased periods2,3,6–8. In real systems, however, there have been few tests for 'paradox' behaviour, and the few results are equivocal9–12. We have now tested for paradox behaviour in populations of the freshwater zooplankter Daphnia and their algal prey. In lakes and ponds these populations show both stable and cyclic dynamics13,14 caused by the interaction between the populations. The cycles are not driven by external forces14,15, but do not seem to be of the paradox-of-enrichment type: their amplitude is small, their period (equal to a Daphnia generation) is short, and there is good evidence that they are caused by the developmental delay of Daphnia14,15. Stage-structured models of the Daphnia–algae interaction indicate that such single-generation 'time-lag' cycles occur in the progression of instability from stable equilibrium to paradox cycles6,7, and that this progression may be driven by increasing nutrient levels7. We show here, however, that enrichment does not lead to paradox cycles, either in field or experimental Daphnia–algae systems. We suggest that concomitant changes in the predator–prey interaction accompanying enrichment could account for the absence of paradox behaviour.},

	abstract = {We analyzed over 20 study-years of data from populations of Daphnia and algae in a wide variety of field situations. These systems display three types of dynamic behavior: both populations stable; both populations cyclic; and Daphnia cyclic but algae stable. The last pattern occurs whether we analyze the total amount of algae or only edible algae. There is evidence that this range of dynamics arises from the interaction between Daphnia and its food supply, occurring in systems that are structurally the same; that is, differences in biological rates or time delays, alone, can explain the existence of different dynamic classes. This is particularly the case when different classes occur in the same species in the same environment in different years, or in similar and adjacent habitats at the same time. The cycles thus appear to be internally driven, rather than resulting from external, cyclic, forcing factors. These findings support a basic premise of most mathematical models in ecology. The broad dynamic patterns in cyclic field populations of Daphnia are similar to those found in laboratory populations. The two sets of cycles have very similar periods and (small) amplitudes; both are single-generation cycles (i.e., the period of a cycle is one generation); and both are caused by dominance and suppression, whereby each cohort suppresses reproduction until its density declines sufficiently to allow production of another cohort. The demographic features of laboratory and field cycles are also similar in detail. Since algae are dynamic in the field but not in the laboratory, we cannot conclude that the mechanisms driving laboratory and field cycles are identical. Our hypothesis is that the presence or absence of cycles is determined by the relationships between time delays in Daphnia and other rates in the interacting populations. There is, however, no obvious environmental factor affecting these rates and delays, thereby determining which dynamic class a particular system fits at a particular time. It does not appear that change in the average temperature is the critical factor. Similar single-generation cycles appear to occur in other systems and may be driven by similar dominance-and-suppression mechanisms.},

Experiments show that this system fits the theory's assumptions7,8,9, yet it is not destabilized by enrichment6. We have tested and rejected four of five proposed explanations10. Here, we investigate the fifth mechanism: inedible algae in nutrient-rich lakes suppress cycles by reducing nutrients available to edible algae. We found three novel results in nutrient-rich microcosms from which inedible algae were excluded. First, as predicted by theory, some Daphnia-edible algal systems now display large-amplitude predator-prey cycles. Second, in the same environment, other populations are stable, showing only small-amplitude demographic cycles. Stability is induced when Daphnia diverts energy from the immediate production of young. Third, the system exhibits coexisting attractors—a stable equilibrium and large-amplitude cycle. We describe a mechanism that flips the system between these two states.},
