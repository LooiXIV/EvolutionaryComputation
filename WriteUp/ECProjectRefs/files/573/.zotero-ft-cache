Abstract

A 1-dimensional, linked hydrodynamic and eutrophication model was developed and calibrated with 19 years of observations (1987–2005) for the summer stratification period in the central basin of Lake Erie, corroborated by comparison with observed process rates and areal hypoxic extents, and confirmed with observations from the 1960s and 1970s. The model effectively captures observations of both vertical and temporal trends in dissolved oxygen, as well as temporal trends in chlorophyll-a, phosphorus, zooplankton biomass, and several key processes. The model was used to develop a relationship between external phosphorus load and hypolimnion oxygen conditions, and then to establish load–response envelopes that account for inter-annual variability in physical conditions driven by variation in meteorological drivers. The curves provide a valuable tool for reassessing phosphorus loading targets with respect to reducing hypoxia in Lake Erie.

Introduction

Lake Erie experienced cultural eutrophication ( Beeton, 1963 ), recovery in response to load reductions ( DePinto et al., 1986 ), and a recent return to eutrophic conditions of the past ( Bridgeman et al., 2013 , Burns et al., 2005  and  Zhou et al., 2013 ). Among symptoms of eutrophication, hypoxia (dissolved oxygen concentration below 2 mg·L − 1 ) has been a key indicator for Lake Erie's central basin ( El-Shaarawi, 1987  and  Rosa and Burns, 1987 ) and excess phosphorus (P) loading from point and agricultural non-point sources ( Dolan, 1993  and  Dolan and Chapra, 2012 ) has been the key driver in both its growth and recovery phases.

In response to concern about the consequences of eutrophication in the 1960 and 1970s, the governments of the U.S. and Canada, largely through the auspices of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement ( GLWQA, 1978 ), implemented a program of P load reduction that was globally unprecedented ( DePinto et al., 1986 ). A combination of point and non-point phosphorus load reductions achieved the target load of 11,000 metric tons per year, and the response of the lake was rapid, profound, and close to that predicted by models. However, despite this apparent success at reducing central basin hypoxia, eutrophication reemerged in the mid-1990s and is now approaching extents of the early decades ( Zhou et al., 2013 ).

Among the several natural and anthropogenic factors potentially responsible for altering hypoxic conditions, changes in climate and hydrology ( Blumberg and Di Toro, 1990  and  Diaz, 2001 ) and changes in phosphorus loading are key, and thus the subject of this analysis. To perform this analysis, we employed a 1-dimensional linked hydrodynamic-eutrophication model for the Central Basin of Lake Erie. This model offers three key innovations: 1) testing the system response variability over 19 years of observed conditions; 2) employing a novel relationship for estimating SOD under future loads; and 3) for the first time providing simulations and forecasts for hypoxic area (as opposed to DO concentration) under a range of nutrient loads. Hypoxic area is a key management target, and this is the first model to provide those projections. While the potential role of the invasive benthic filter feeders (e.g., zebra and quagga mussels; Woynarovich, 1961 ), the potential contribution of winter diatom growth to summer oxygen demand ( Twiss et al., 2013 ), and the impact of circulation patterns ( Beletsky et al., 2013  and  Rao et al., 2008 ) cannot be discounted, they are not the focus of this paper.
Modeling approach

Several linked or coupled hydrodynamic-eutrophication models have been developed for Lake Erie. The spatial sophistication of these works has varied from a 1D approach as demonstrated here, to 2D ( Zhang et al., 2008 ) and 3D domains ( Di Toro and Connolly, 1980 , Di Toro et al., 1987  and  Leon et al., 2011 ). The complexity of the biological portion of the models has varied greatly, ranging from simple statistical relationships ( Burns et al., 2005 , Rosa and Burns, 1987  and  Rucinski et al., 2010 ) to models using dozens of state variables across multiple environmental media ( Leon et al., 2011 ). All of these approaches have merit for investigating specific forcings of hypoxia in Lake Erie, such as near shore nutrient cycling, or cross lake nutrient transport. However, they are generally limited in their ability to provide forecast management scenarios, either due to exorbitant computation time or lack of input data at the required spatial and temporal scales. Our 1D approach allows for quick simulation of several dozen hypothetical scenarios related to reductions in nutrient loads, inter-annual variability in physical drivers, and long-term change in sediment oxygen demand (SOD) associated with such loads.

Rucinski et al. (2010) demonstrated, with a 1D hydrodynamic model linked to a very simple oxygen demand model that, after accounting for inter-annual variability in temperature and mixing regimes driven by meteorological conditions, there remains significant inter-annual variability and trends in the water column oxygen demand. This oxygen demand is driven by in situ decomposition of autochthonous production of organic matter, which is in turn driven by the availability of phosphorus, the limiting nutrient. To explore those relationships, we developed a eutrophication model, driven by 19 years (1987–2005) of observed nutrient loads and meteorology, to simulate the phosphorus-driven production of organic matter and the contribution of its decay to the evolution of hypolimnion hypoxia in the Central Basin. The model was calibrated to water quality observations from the same 19-year period and compared to observed process rates where available. It should also be noted that this period includes both the decline and the re-emergence of hypoxia through the 1990s ( Zhou et al., 2013 ).

Our one-dimensional hydrodynamic model, representing the offshore waters of the central basin (maximum 24 m in depth, Fig. 1 ), provided the thermal structure and associated vertical mixing input to the eutrophication model. Both models operate on the same spatial scale of 48 half-meter thick layers. The 1-D physical model is based on the Princeton Ocean Model ( Blumberg and Mellor, 1987 ) and was applied previously for Lake Michigan ( Chen et al., 2002 ) and Lake Erie ( Rucinski et al., 2010 ). It uses the Mellor–Yamada turbulence closure scheme to parameterize vertical mixing ( Mellor and Yamada, 1982 ), and is driven by hourly meteorological observations from the Cleveland, Ohio airport with overland–overlake correction described in Beletsky and Schwab (2001) .
