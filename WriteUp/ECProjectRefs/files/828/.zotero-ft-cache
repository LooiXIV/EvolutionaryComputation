Abstract

Climatological studies in which early precipitation records are used frequently lead to the necessity of estimating missing data. The present note summarizes a small series of tests of one objective estimation scheme identical in form to the normal-ratio method of Paulhus and Kohler but applied here to missing seasonal totals rather than to missing storm totals. The results suggest that estimation errors in the neighborhood of 25 pct must be expected in estimating seasonal totals using two index stations under conditions typical of those forced upon the investigator dealing with older records. Increasing the number of index stations beyond two does not seem warranted. Errors of 25 pct in seasonal totals, though not negligible, are small enough compared to coefficients of variation typical of seasonal totals of precipitation in the drier portions of the United States, that the use of such a method in climatic studies is desirable.
