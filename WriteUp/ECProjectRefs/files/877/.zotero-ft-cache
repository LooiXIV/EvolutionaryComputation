Abstract

Dissolved concentrations were determined for Fe, Mn, Al, Cu, Zn, La, U, Th, Cd and As in a wetland and its recipient stream to reveal the effect of seasonal changes in environmental conditions on the cycling and transfer of trace elements at the transition between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These preliminary results from the wetland show marked seasonal changes in dissolved concentration for all elements except Zn and Cu. Concentrations are found to be low until about mid-February and then increase abruptly. The onset of trace element release appears to coincide with a marked decline in redox potential and increase of organic carbon content. Because this decline is itself correlated with a pronounced increase in temperature and dissolved Fe, Mn and organic carbon content, we suggest that the microorganisms which use soil iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides as electron acceptors catalyzed the change in redox conditions and induced an increase of DOC. Temporal changes were also observed in the recipient stream which showed marked positive concentration peaks during stormflow events (except Zn). The seasonal processes occurring in the wetland appear to play a major role in determining the amount of trace elements which are transferred from the wetland to the river.
