Saltwater wedge

    P. G. Holland

Download PDF (34 KB)

A saltwater wedge is a wedge-like intrusion of a large mass of salt (saline) water flowing in from the sea on a flood (inflowing) tide under the fresh water in a tidal waterway. The wedge occurs because of the differing densities of the saline and the fresh water and the difference may be exacerbated by differing temperatures of the two types of water. Consideration of the effects of a saltwater wedge is important in relation to sedimentation, the conveyance of solids in the waters and matters of water quality. In recent years, many coastal sewage outfalls have had to be modified, rebuilt or even abandoned because of a lack of previous understanding of the effects of saltwater wedges.
